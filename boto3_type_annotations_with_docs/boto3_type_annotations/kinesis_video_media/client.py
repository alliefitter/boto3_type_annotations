          You must first call the ``GetDataEndpoint`` API to get an endpoint to which you can then send the ``GetMedia`` requests. 
        
        When you put media data (fragments) on a stream, Kinesis Video Streams stores each incoming fragment and related metadata in what is called a \"chunk.\" For more information, see . The ``GetMedia`` API returns a stream of these chunks starting from the chunk that you specify in the request. 
        
        The following limits apply when using the ``GetMedia`` API:
        
        * A client can call ``GetMedia`` up to five times per second per stream.  
         
        * Kinesis Video Streams sends media data at a rate of up to 25 megabytes per second (or 200 megabits per second) during a ``GetMedia`` session.

            A time stamp value. This value is required if you choose the PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP or the SERVER_TIMESTAMP as the ``startSelectorType`` . The ``GetMedia`` API then starts with the chunk containing the fragment that has the specified time stamp.
