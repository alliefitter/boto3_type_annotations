          The minimum number of healthy instances that should be available at any time during the deployment. There are two parameters expected in the input: type and value.
        
          The type parameter takes either of the following values:

If you specify FLEET_PERCENT, at the start of the deployment, AWS CodeDeploy converts the percentage to the equivalent number of instance and rounds up fractional instances. 
           
          The value parameter takes an integer.
        
          For example, to set a minimum of 95% healthy instance, specify a type of FLEET_PERCENT and a value of 95.

            The minimum healthy instance type:
        
            * HOST_COUNT: The minimum number of healthy instance as an absolute value. 
             
            * FLEET_PERCENT: The minimum number of healthy instance as a percentage of the total number of instance in the deployment. 
             
            In an example of nine instance, if a HOST_COUNT of six is specified, deploy to up to three instances at a time. The deployment will be successful if six or more instances are deployed to successfully; otherwise, the deployment fails. If a FLEET_PERCENT of 40 is specified, deploy to up to five instance at a time. The deployment will be successful if four or more instance are deployed to successfully; otherwise, the deployment fails.
        
            .. note::
        
              In a call to the get deployment configuration operation, CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime will return a minimum healthy instance type of MOST_CONCURRENCY and a value of 1. This means a deployment to only one instance at a time. (You cannot set the type to MOST_CONCURRENCY, only to HOST_COUNT or FLEET_PERCENT.) In addition, with CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime, AWS CodeDeploy will try to ensure that all instances but one are kept in a healthy state during the deployment. Although this allows one instance at a time to be taken offline for a new deployment, it also means that if the deployment to the last instance fails, the overall deployment still succeeds.

                If true, then if the deployment causes the ApplicationStop deployment lifecycle event to an instance to fail, the deployment to that instance will not be considered to have failed at that point and will continue on to the BeforeInstall deployment lifecycle event.
        
                If false or not specified, then if the deployment causes the ApplicationStop deployment lifecycle event to an instance to fail, the deployment to that instance will stop, and the deployment to that instance will be considered to have failed.

              Information about the deployment configuration.
        
              - **deploymentConfigId** *(string) --* 
        
                The deployment configuration ID.
        
              - **deploymentConfigName** *(string) --* 
        
                The deployment configuration name.
        
              - **minimumHealthyHosts** *(dict) --* 
        
                Information about the number or percentage of minimum healthy instance.
        
                - **value** *(integer) --* 
        
                  The minimum healthy instance value.
        
                - **type** *(string) --* 
        
                  The minimum healthy instance type:
        
                  * HOST_COUNT: The minimum number of healthy instance as an absolute value. 
                   
                  * FLEET_PERCENT: The minimum number of healthy instance as a percentage of the total number of instance in the deployment. 
                   
                  In an example of nine instance, if a HOST_COUNT of six is specified, deploy to up to three instances at a time. The deployment will be successful if six or more instances are deployed to successfully; otherwise, the deployment fails. If a FLEET_PERCENT of 40 is specified, deploy to up to five instance at a time. The deployment will be successful if four or more instance are deployed to successfully; otherwise, the deployment fails.
        
                  .. note::
        
                    In a call to the get deployment configuration operation, CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime will return a minimum healthy instance type of MOST_CONCURRENCY and a value of 1. This means a deployment to only one instance at a time. (You cannot set the type to MOST_CONCURRENCY, only to HOST_COUNT or FLEET_PERCENT.) In addition, with CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime, AWS CodeDeploy will try to ensure that all instances but one are kept in a healthy state during the deployment. Although this allows one instance at a time to be taken offline for a new deployment, it also means that if the deployment to the last instance fails, the overall deployment still succeeds.
