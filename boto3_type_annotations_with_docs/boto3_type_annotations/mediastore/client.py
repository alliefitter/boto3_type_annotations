In this case, the response includes a token. To get the next set of containers, send the command again, this time with the ``NextToken`` parameter (with the returned token as its value). The next set of responses appears, with a token if there are still more containers to receive. 
        
        See also  DescribeContainer , which gets the properties of one container.

                  The DNS endpoint of the container. Use the endpoint to identify the specific container when sending requests to the data plane. The service assigns this value when the container is created. Once the value has been assigned, it does not change.
        
                - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 
        
                  Unix timestamp.

                  The status of container creation or deletion. The status is one of the following: ``CREATING`` , ``ACTIVE`` , or ``DELETING`` . While the service is creating the container, the status is ``CREATING`` . When the endpoint is available, the status changes to ``ACTIVE`` .
        
            - **NextToken** *(string) --* 
        
               ``NextToken`` is the token to use in the next call to ``ListContainers`` . This token is returned only if you included the ``MaxResults`` tag in the original command, and only if there are still containers to return.

You can add up to 100 rules to a CORS policy. If more than one rule applies, the service uses the first applicable rule listed.
