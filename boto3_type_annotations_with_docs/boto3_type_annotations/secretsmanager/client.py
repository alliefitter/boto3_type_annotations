        Secrets Manager stores the encrypted secret data in one of a collection of \"versions\" associated with the secret. Each version contains a copy of the encrypted secret data. Each version is associated with one or more \"staging labels\" that identify where the version is in the rotation cycle. The ``SecretVersionsToStages`` field of the secret contains the mapping of staging labels to the active versions of the secret. Versions without a staging label are considered deprecated and are not included in the list.
        
        You provide the secret data to be encrypted by putting text in either the ``SecretString`` parameter or binary data in the ``SecretBinary`` parameter, but not both. If you include ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` then Secrets Manager also creates an initial secret version and automatically attaches the staging label ``AWSCURRENT`` to the new version.

          * If you call an operation that needs to encrypt or decrypt the ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` for a secret in the same account as the calling user and that secret doesn\'t specify a AWS KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the account\'s default AWS managed customer master key (CMK) with the alias ``aws/secretsmanager`` . If this key doesn\'t already exist in your account then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the same AWS account automatically have access to use the default CMK. Note that if an Secrets Manager API call results in AWS having to create the account\'s AWS-managed CMK, it can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result. 
           
          * If the secret is in a different AWS account from the credentials calling an API that requires encryption or decryption of the secret value then you must create and use a custom AWS KMS CMK because you can\'t access the default CMK for the account using credentials from a different AWS account. Store the ARN of the CMK in the secret when you create the secret or when you update it by including it in the ``KMSKeyId`` . If you call an API that must encrypt or decrypt ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` using credentials from a different account then the AWS KMS key policy must grant cross-account access to that other account\'s user or role for both the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt operations.

            Don\'t end your secret name with a hyphen followed by six characters. If you do so, you risk confusion and unexpected results when searching for a secret by partial ARN. This is because Secrets Manager automatically adds a hyphen and six random characters at the end of the ARN.
        
        :type ClientRequestToken: string
        :param ClientRequestToken: 
        
          (Optional) If you include ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` , then an initial version is created as part of the secret, and this parameter specifies a unique identifier for the new version. 
        
          .. note::
        
            If you use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDK to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes it as the value for this parameter in the request. If you don\'t use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ``ClientRequestToken`` yourself for the new version and include that value in the request.
        
          This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during a rotation. We recommend that you generate a `UUID-type <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__ value to ensure uniqueness of your versions within the specified secret. 
        
          * If the ``ClientRequestToken`` value isn\'t already associated with a version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.  
           
          * If a version with this value already exists and that version\'s ``SecretString`` and ``SecretBinary`` values are the same as those in the request, then the request is ignored (the operation is idempotent). 
           
          * If a version with this value already exists and that version\'s ``SecretString`` and ``SecretBinary`` values are different from those in the request then the request fails because you cannot modify an existing version. Instead, use  PutSecretValue to create a new version. 
           
          This value becomes the ``VersionId`` of the new version.
        
          This field is autopopulated if not provided.
        
        :type Description: string
        :param Description: 
        
          (Optional) Specifies a user-provided description of the secret.

        :param KmsKeyId: 
        
          (Optional) Specifies the ARN, Key ID, or alias of the AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) to be used to encrypt the ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` values in the versions stored in this secret.
        
          You can specify any of the supported ways to identify a AWS KMS key ID. If you need to reference a CMK in a different account, you can use only the key ARN or the alias ARN.
        
          If you don\'t specify this value, then Secrets Manager defaults to using the AWS account\'s default CMK (the one named ``aws/secretsmanager`` ). If a AWS KMS CMK with that name doesn\'t yet exist, then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically the first time it needs to encrypt a version\'s ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` fields.
        
          .. warning::
        
            You can use the account\'s default CMK to encrypt and decrypt only if you call this operation using credentials from the same account that owns the secret. If the secret is in a different account, then you must create a custom CMK and specify the ARN in this field. 
        
        :type SecretBinary: bytes
        :param SecretBinary: 
        
          (Optional) Specifies binary data that you want to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret. To use this parameter in the command-line tools, we recommend that you store your binary data in a file and then use the appropriate technique for your tool to pass the contents of the file as a parameter.
        
          Either ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be empty.
        
          This parameter is not available using the Secrets Manager console. It can be accessed only by using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs.
        
        :type SecretString: string
        :param SecretString: 
        
          (Optional) Specifies text data that you want to encrypt and store in this new version of the secret.
        
          Either ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be empty.
        
          If you create a secret by using the Secrets Manager console then Secrets Manager puts the protected secret text in only the ``SecretString`` parameter. The Secrets Manager console stores the information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs that the Lambda rotation function knows how to parse.
        
          For storing multiple values, we recommend that you use a JSON text string argument and specify key/value pairs. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see `Using JSON for Parameters <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-using-param.html#cli-using-param-json>`__ in the *AWS CLI User Guide* . For example:
        
           ``[{\"username\":\"bob\"},{\"password\":\"abc123xyz456\"}]``  
        
          If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text. 
        
        :type Tags: list
        :param Tags: 
        
          (Optional) Specifies a list of user-defined tags that are attached to the secret. Each tag is a \"Key\" and \"Value\" pair of strings. This operation only appends tags to the existing list of tags. To remove tags, you must use  UntagResource .
        
          .. warning::
        
            * Secrets Manager tag key names are case sensitive. A tag with the key \"ABC\" is a different tag from one with key \"abc\". 
             
            * If you check tags in IAM policy ``Condition`` elements as part of your security strategy, then adding or removing a tag can change permissions. If the successful completion of this operation would result in you losing your permissions for this secret, then this operation is blocked and returns an ``Access Denied`` error. 
             
          This parameter requires a JSON text string argument. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see `Using JSON for Parameters <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-using-param.html#cli-using-param-json>`__ in the *AWS CLI User Guide* . For example:
        
           ``[{\"Key\":\"CostCenter\",\"Value\":\"12345\"},{\"Key\":\"environment\",\"Value\":\"production\"}]``  
        
          If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text. 
        
          The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
        
          * Maximum number of tags per secret—50 
           
          * Maximum key length—127 Unicode characters in UTF-8 
           
          * Maximum value length—255 Unicode characters in UTF-8 
           
          * Tag keys and values are case sensitive. 
           
          * Do not use the ``aws:`` prefix in your tag names or values because it is reserved for AWS use. You can\'t edit or delete tag names or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per secret limit. 
           
          * If your tagging schema will be used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services might have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, spaces, and numbers representable in UTF-8, plus the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @.

            If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names that end with a hyphen followed by six characters.

          An asynchronous background process performs the actual deletion, so there can be a short delay before the operation completes. If you write code to delete and then immediately recreate a secret with the same name, ensure that your code includes appropriate back off and retry logic.
        
          .. warning::
        
            Use this parameter with caution. This parameter causes the operation to skip the normal waiting period before the permanent deletion that AWS would normally impose with the ``RecoveryWindowInDays`` parameter. If you delete a secret with the ``ForceDeleteWithouRecovery`` parameter, then you have no opportunity to recover the secret. It is permanently lost.

              Specifies whether automatic rotation is enabled for this secret.
        
              To enable rotation, use  RotateSecret with ``AutomaticallyRotateAfterDays`` set to a value greater than 0. To disable rotation, use  CancelRotateSecret .
        
            - **RotationLambdaARN** *(string) --*

                Specifies the number of days between automatic scheduled rotations of the secret.
        
                Secrets Manager schedules the next rotation when the previous one is complete. Secrets Manager schedules the date by adding the rotation interval (number of days) to the actual date of the last rotation. The service chooses the hour within that 24-hour date window randomly. The minute is also chosen somewhat randomly, but weighted towards the top of the hour and influenced by a variety of factors that help distribute load.
        
            - **LastRotatedDate** *(datetime) --* 
        
              The most recent date and time that the Secrets Manager rotation process was successfully completed. This value is null if the secret has never rotated.
        
            - **LastChangedDate** *(datetime) --* 
        
              The last date and time that this secret was modified in any way.
        
            - **LastAccessedDate** *(datetime) --* 
        
              The last date that this secret was accessed. This value is truncated to midnight of the date and therefore shows only the date, not the time.
        
            - **DeletedDate** *(datetime) --* 
        
              This value exists if the secret is scheduled for deletion. Some time after the specified date and time, Secrets Manager deletes the secret and all of its versions.
        
              If a secret is scheduled for deletion, then its details, including the encrypted secret information, is not accessible. To cancel a scheduled deletion and restore access, use  RestoreSecret .
        
            - **Tags** *(list) --* 
        
              The list of user-defined tags that are associated with the secret. To add tags to a secret, use  TagResource . To remove tags, use  UntagResource .
        
              - *(dict) --* 
        
                A structure that contains information about a tag.
        
                - **Key** *(string) --* 
        
                  The key identifier, or name, of the tag.
        
                - **Value** *(string) --* 
        
                  The string value that\'s associated with the key of the tag.
        
            - **VersionIdsToStages** *(dict) --* 
        
              A list of all of the currently assigned ``VersionStage`` staging labels and the ``VersionId`` that each is attached to. Staging labels are used to keep track of the different versions during the rotation process.
        
              .. note::
        
                A version that does not have any staging labels attached is considered deprecated and subject to deletion. Such versions are not included in this list.

A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names that end with a hyphen followed by six characters.

              A list of the secrets in the account.
        
              - *(dict) --* 
        
                A structure that contains the details about a secret. It does not include the encrypted ``SecretString`` and ``SecretBinary`` values. To get those values, use the  GetSecretValue operation.
        
                - **ARN** *(string) --* 
        
                  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret.
        
                  For more information about ARNs in Secrets Manager, see `Policy Resources <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_iam-permissions.html#iam-resources>`__ in the *AWS Secrets Manager User Guide* .
        
                - **Name** *(string) --* 
        
                  The friendly name of the secret. You can use forward slashes in the name to represent a path hierarchy. For example, ``/prod/databases/dbserver1`` could represent the secret for a server named ``dbserver1`` in the folder ``databases`` in the folder ``prod`` . 
        
                - **Description** *(string) --* 
        
                  The user-provided description of the secret.
        
                - **KmsKeyId** *(string) --* 
        
                  The ARN or alias of the AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) that\'s used to encrypt the ``SecretString`` and ``SecretBinary`` fields in each version of the secret. If you don\'t provide a key, then Secrets Manager defaults to encrypting the secret fields with the default KMS CMK (the one named ``awssecretsmanager`` ) for this account.
        
                - **RotationEnabled** *(boolean) --* 
        
                  Indicated whether automatic, scheduled rotation is enabled for this secret.
        
                - **RotationLambdaARN** *(string) --* 
        
                  The ARN of an AWS Lambda function that\'s invoked by Secrets Manager to rotate and expire the secret either automatically per the schedule or manually by a call to  RotateSecret .
        
                - **RotationRules** *(dict) --* 
        
                  A structure that defines the rotation configuration for the secret.
        
                  - **AutomaticallyAfterDays** *(integer) --* 
        
                    Specifies the number of days between automatic scheduled rotations of the secret.
        
                    Secrets Manager schedules the next rotation when the previous one is complete. Secrets Manager schedules the date by adding the rotation interval (number of days) to the actual date of the last rotation. The service chooses the hour within that 24-hour date window randomly. The minute is also chosen somewhat randomly, but weighted towards the top of the hour and influenced by a variety of factors that help distribute load.
        
                - **LastRotatedDate** *(datetime) --* 
        
                  The last date and time that the rotation process for this secret was invoked.
        
                - **LastChangedDate** *(datetime) --* 
        
                  The last date and time that this secret was modified in any way.
        
                - **LastAccessedDate** *(datetime) --* 
        
                  The last date that this secret was accessed. This value is truncated to midnight of the date and therefore shows only the date, not the time.
        
                - **DeletedDate** *(datetime) --* 
        
                  The date and time on which this secret was deleted. Not present on active secrets. The secret can be recovered until the number of days in the recovery window has passed, as specified in the ``RecoveryWindowInDays`` parameter of the  DeleteSecret operation.
        
                - **Tags** *(list) --* 
        
                  The list of user-defined tags that are associated with the secret. To add tags to a secret, use  TagResource . To remove tags, use  UntagResource .
        
                  - *(dict) --* 
        
                    A structure that contains information about a tag.
        
                    - **Key** *(string) --* 
        
                      The key identifier, or name, of the tag.
        
                    - **Value** *(string) --* 
        
                      The string value that\'s associated with the key of the tag.
        
                - **SecretVersionsToStages** *(dict) --* 
        
                  A list of all of the currently assigned ``SecretVersionStage`` staging labels and the ``SecretVersionId`` that each is attached to. Staging labels are used to keep track of the different versions during the rotation process.
        
                  .. note::
        
                    A version that does not have any ``SecretVersionStage`` is considered deprecated and subject to deletion. Such versions are not included in this list.
        
                  - *(string) --* 
                    
                    - *(list) --* 
                      
                      - *(string) --* 
                  
            - **NextToken** *(string) --* 
        
              If present in the response, this value indicates that there\'s more output available than what\'s included in the current response. This can occur even when the response includes no values at all, such as when you ask for a filtered view of a very long list. Use this value in the ``NextToken`` request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to continue processing and get the next part of the output. You should repeat this until the ``NextToken`` response element comes back empty (as ``null`` ).

        .. note::
        
          The Secrets Manager console uses only the ``SecretString`` field. To add binary data to a secret with the ``SecretBinary`` field you must use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs.
        
        * If this operation creates the first version for the secret then Secrets Manager automatically attaches the staging label ``AWSCURRENT`` to the new version. 
         
        * If another version of this secret already exists, then this operation does not automatically move any staging labels other than those that you explicitly specify in the ``VersionStages`` parameter. 
         
        * If this operation moves the staging label ``AWSCURRENT`` from another version to this version (because you included it in the ``StagingLabels`` parameter) then Secrets Manager also automatically moves the staging label ``AWSPREVIOUS`` to the version that ``AWSCURRENT`` was removed from. 
         
        * This operation is idempotent. If a version with a ``VersionId`` with the same value as the ``ClientRequestToken`` parameter already exists and you specify the same secret data, the operation succeeds but does nothing. However, if the secret data is different, then the operation fails because you cannot modify an existing version; you can only create new ones. 
         
        .. note::
        
          * If you call an operation that needs to encrypt or decrypt the ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` for a secret in the same account as the calling user and that secret doesn\'t specify a AWS KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the account\'s default AWS managed customer master key (CMK) with the alias ``aws/secretsmanager`` . If this key doesn\'t already exist in your account then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the same AWS account automatically have access to use the default CMK. Note that if an Secrets Manager API call results in AWS having to create the account\'s AWS-managed CMK, it can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result. 
           
          * If the secret is in a different AWS account from the credentials calling an API that requires encryption or decryption of the secret value then you must create and use a custom AWS KMS CMK because you can\'t access the default CMK for the account using credentials from a different AWS account. Store the ARN of the CMK in the secret when you create the secret or when you update it by including it in the ``KMSKeyId`` . If you call an API that must encrypt or decrypt ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` using credentials from a different account then the AWS KMS key policy must grant cross-account access to that other account\'s user or role for both the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt operations.

            If you use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDK to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes that in the request. If you don\'t use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ``ClientRequestToken`` yourself for new versions and include that value in the request. 
        
          This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during the Lambda rotation function\'s processing. We recommend that you generate a `UUID-type <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__ value to ensure uniqueness within the specified secret. 
        
          * If the ``ClientRequestToken`` value isn\'t already associated with a version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.  
           
          * If a version with this value already exists and that version\'s ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` values are the same as those in the request then the request is ignored (the operation is idempotent).  
           
          * If a version with this value already exists and that version\'s ``SecretString`` and ``SecretBinary`` values are different from those in the request then the request fails because you cannot modify an existing secret version. You can only create new versions to store new secret values. 
           
          This value becomes the ``VersionId`` of the new version.
        
          This field is autopopulated if not provided.
        
        :type SecretBinary: bytes
        :param SecretBinary: 
        
          (Optional) Specifies binary data that you want to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret. To use this parameter in the command-line tools, we recommend that you store your binary data in a file and then use the appropriate technique for your tool to pass the contents of the file as a parameter. Either ``SecretBinary`` or ``SecretString`` must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be empty.
        
          This parameter is not accessible if the secret using the Secrets Manager console.
        
        :type SecretString: string
        :param SecretString: 
        
          (Optional) Specifies text data that you want to encrypt and store in this new version of the secret. Either ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be empty.
        
          If you create this secret by using the Secrets Manager console then Secrets Manager puts the protected secret text in only the ``SecretString`` parameter. The Secrets Manager console stores the information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs that the default Lambda rotation function knows how to parse.
        
          For storing multiple values, we recommend that you use a JSON text string argument and specify key/value pairs. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see `Using JSON for Parameters <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-using-param.html#cli-using-param-json>`__ in the *AWS CLI User Guide* .
        
          For example:
        
           ``[{\"username\":\"bob\"},{\"password\":\"abc123xyz456\"}]``  
        
          If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text.
        
        :type VersionStages: list
        :param VersionStages: 
        
          (Optional) Specifies a list of staging labels that are attached to this version of the secret. These staging labels are used to track the versions through the rotation process by the Lambda rotation function.
        
          A staging label must be unique to a single version of the secret. If you specify a staging label that\'s already associated with a different version of the same secret then that staging label is automatically removed from the other version and attached to this version.
        
          If you do not specify a value for ``VersionStages`` then Secrets Manager automatically moves the staging label ``AWSCURRENT`` to this new version.

        This required configuration information includes the ARN of an AWS Lambda function and the time between scheduled rotations. The Lambda rotation function creates a new version of the secret and creates or updates the credentials on the protected service to match. After testing the new credentials, the function marks the new secret with the staging label ``AWSCURRENT`` so that your clients all immediately begin to use the new version. For more information about rotating secrets and how to configure a Lambda function to rotate the secrets for your protected service, see `Rotating Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotating-secrets.html>`__ in the *AWS Secrets Manager User Guide* .
        
        Secrets Manager schedules the next rotation when the previous one is complete. Secrets Manager schedules the date by adding the rotation interval (number of days) to the actual date of the last rotation. The service chooses the hour within that 24-hour date window randomly. The minute is also chosen somewhat randomly, but weighted towards the top of the hour and influenced by a variety of factors that help distribute load.
        
        The rotation function must end with the versions of the secret in one of two states:
        
        * The ``AWSPENDING`` and ``AWSCURRENT`` staging labels are attached to the same version of the secret, or 
         
        * The ``AWSPENDING`` staging label is not attached to any version of the secret. 
         
        If instead the ``AWSPENDING`` staging label is present but is not attached to the same version as ``AWSCURRENT`` then any later invocation of ``RotateSecret`` assumes that a previous rotation request is still in progress and returns an error.

          (Optional) Specifies an updated ARN or alias of the AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) to be used to encrypt the protected text in new versions of this secret.
        
          .. warning::
        
            You can only use the account\'s default CMK to encrypt and decrypt if you call this operation using credentials from the same account that owns the secret. If the secret is in a different account, then you must create a custom CMK and provide the ARN of that CMK in this field. The user making the call must have permissions to both the secret and the CMK in their respective accounts.
        
        :type SecretBinary: bytes
        :param SecretBinary: 
        
          (Optional) Specifies updated binary data that you want to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret. To use this parameter in the command-line tools, we recommend that you store your binary data in a file and then use the appropriate technique for your tool to pass the contents of the file as a parameter. Either ``SecretBinary`` or ``SecretString`` must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be empty.
        
          This parameter is not accessible using the Secrets Manager console.
        
        :type SecretString: string
        :param SecretString: 
        
          (Optional) Specifies updated text data that you want to encrypt and store in this new version of the secret. Either ``SecretBinary`` or ``SecretString`` must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be empty.
        
          If you create this secret by using the Secrets Manager console then Secrets Manager puts the protected secret text in only the ``SecretString`` parameter. The Secrets Manager console stores the information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs that the default Lambda rotation function knows how to parse.
        
          For storing multiple values, we recommend that you use a JSON text string argument and specify key/value pairs. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see `Using JSON for Parameters <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-using-param.html#cli-using-param-json>`__ in the *AWS CLI User Guide* . For example:
        
           ``[{\"username\":\"bob\"},{\"password\":\"abc123xyz456\"}]``  
        
          If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text. You can also \'escape\' the double quote character in the embedded JSON text by prefacing each with a backslash. For example, the following string is surrounded by double-quotes. All of the embedded double quotes are escaped:
        
           ``\"[{\\"username\\":\\"bob\\"},{\\"password\\":\\"abc123xyz456\\"}]\"``

                Secrets Manager automatically adds several random characters to the name at the end of the ARN when you initially create a secret. This affects only the ARN and not the actual friendly name. This ensures that if you create a new secret with the same name as an old secret that you previously deleted, then users with access to the old secret *don\'t* automatically get access to the new secret because the ARNs are different.
        
            - **Name** *(string) --*

          Whenever you move ``AWSCURRENT`` , Secrets Manager automatically moves the label ``AWSPREVIOUS`` to the version that ``AWSCURRENT`` was removed from.
        
        If this action results in the last label being removed from a version, then the version is considered to be \'deprecated\' and can be deleted by Secrets Manager.

          Specifies the secret with the version whose list of staging labels you want to modify. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.
        
          .. note::
        
            If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names that end with a hyphen followed by six characters.

          Specifies the secret version ID of the version that the staging label is to be removed from. If the staging label you are trying to attach to one version is already attached to a different version, then you must include this parameter and specify the version that the label is to be removed from. If the label is attached and you either do not specify this parameter, or the version ID does not match, then the operation fails.
