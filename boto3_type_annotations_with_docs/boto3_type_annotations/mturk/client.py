The HITTypeID can be used to create additional HITs in the future without needing to specify common parameters such as the title, description and reward amount each time.

        CreateHIT also supports several ways to provide question data: by providing a value for the ``Question`` parameter that fully specifies the contents of the HIT, or by providing a ``HitLayoutId`` and associated ``HitLayoutParameters`` .

          A general description of the HIT. A description includes detailed information about the kind of task the HIT contains. On the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, the HIT description appears in the expanded view of search results, and in the HIT and assignment screens. A good description gives the user enough information to evaluate the HIT before accepting it.

        :param RequesterAnnotation: 
        
          An arbitrary data field. The RequesterAnnotation parameter lets your application attach arbitrary data to the HIT for tracking purposes. For example, this parameter could be an identifier internal to the Requester\'s application that corresponds with the HIT. 
        
          The RequesterAnnotation parameter for a HIT is only visible to the Requester who created the HIT. It is not shown to the Worker, or any other Requester. 
        
          The RequesterAnnotation parameter may be different for each HIT you submit. It does not affect how your HITs are grouped.

        :param QualificationRequirements: 
        
          Conditions that a Worker\'s Qualifications must meet in order to accept the HIT. A HIT can have between zero and ten Qualification requirements. All requirements must be met in order for a Worker to accept the HIT. Additionally, other actions can be restricted using the ``ActionsGuarded`` field on each ``QualificationRequirement`` structure. 
        
          - *(dict) --* 
        
            The QualificationRequirement data structure describes a Qualification that a Worker must have before the Worker is allowed to accept a HIT. A requirement may optionally state that a Worker must have the Qualification in order to preview the HIT, or see the HIT in search results. 
        
            - **QualificationTypeId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
              The ID of the Qualification type for the requirement.
        
            - **Comparator** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
              The kind of comparison to make against a Qualification\'s value. You can compare a Qualification\'s value to an IntegerValue to see if it is LessThan, LessThanOrEqualTo, GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the IntegerValue. You can compare it to a LocaleValue to see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue. You can check to see if the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or LocaleValue values. Lastly, a Qualification requirement can also test if a Qualification Exists or DoesNotExist in the user\'s profile, regardless of its value. 
        
            - **IntegerValues** *(list) --* 
        
              The integer value to compare against the Qualification\'s value. IntegerValue must not be present if Comparator is Exists or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can only be used if the Qualification type has an integer value; it cannot be used with the Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 15 IntegerValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure. 
        
              - *(integer) --* 
        
            - **LocaleValues** *(list) --* 
        
              The locale value to compare against the Qualification\'s value. The local value must be a valid ISO 3166 country code or supports ISO 3166-2 subdivisions. LocaleValue can only be used with a Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. LocaleValue can only be used with the EqualTo, NotEqualTo, In, and NotIn comparators. You must only use a single LocaleValue element when using the EqualTo or NotEqualTo comparators. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 30 LocaleValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure. 
        
              - *(dict) --* 
        
                The Locale data structure represents a geographical region or location.
        
                - **Country** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
                  The country of the locale. Must be a valid ISO 3166 country code. For example, the code US refers to the United States of America. 
        
                - **Subdivision** *(string) --* 
        
                  The state or subdivision of the locale. A valid ISO 3166-2 subdivision code. For example, the code WA refers to the state of Washington.
        
            - **RequiredToPreview** *(boolean) --* 
        
              DEPRECATED: Use the ``ActionsGuarded`` field instead. If RequiredToPreview is true, the question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do not meet this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker\'s Qualifications must meet all of the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the HIT. If a Worker meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are no such requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT, the Worker will be allowed to preview the HIT\'s question data, but will not be allowed to accept and complete the HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in combination with the ``ActionsGuarded`` field. 
        
            - **ActionsGuarded** *(string) --* 
        
              Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include \"Accept\" (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their search results), \"PreviewAndAccept\" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can see the HIT in their search results), and \"DiscoverPreviewAndAccept\" (Worker cannot accept, preview, or see the HIT in their search results). It\'s possible for you to create a HIT with multiple QualificationRequirements (which can have different values for the ActionGuarded attribute). In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least restrictive to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet all requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or Accept the HIT. ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the ``RequiredToPreview`` field. 
        
        :type UniqueRequestToken: string
        :param UniqueRequestToken: 
        
          A unique identifier for this request which allows you to retry the call on error without creating duplicate HITs. This is useful in cases such as network timeouts where it is unclear whether or not the call succeeded on the server. If the HIT already exists in the system from a previous call using the same UniqueRequestToken, subsequent calls will return a AWS.MechanicalTurk.HitAlreadyExists error with a message containing the HITId. 
        
          .. note::
        
            Note: It is your responsibility to ensure uniqueness of the token. The unique token expires after 24 hours. Subsequent calls using the same UniqueRequestToken made after the 24 hour limit could create duplicate HITs. 
        
        :type AssignmentReviewPolicy: dict
        :param AssignmentReviewPolicy:

              - **Keywords** *(string) --* 
        
                One or more words or phrases that describe the HIT, separated by commas. Search terms similar to the keywords of a HIT are more likely to have the HIT in the search results.
        
              - **HITStatus** *(string) --* 
        
                The status of the HIT and its assignments. Valid Values are Assignable | Unassignable | Reviewable | Reviewing | Disposed.

              - **RequesterAnnotation** *(string) --* 
        
                An arbitrary data field the Requester who created the HIT can use. This field is visible only to the creator of the HIT.
        
              - **QualificationRequirements** *(list) --* 
        
                Conditions that a Worker\'s Qualifications must meet in order to accept the HIT. A HIT can have between zero and ten Qualification requirements. All requirements must be met in order for a Worker to accept the HIT. Additionally, other actions can be restricted using the ``ActionsGuarded`` field on each ``QualificationRequirement`` structure. 
        
                - *(dict) --* 
        
                  The QualificationRequirement data structure describes a Qualification that a Worker must have before the Worker is allowed to accept a HIT. A requirement may optionally state that a Worker must have the Qualification in order to preview the HIT, or see the HIT in search results. 
        
                  - **QualificationTypeId** *(string) --* 
        
                    The ID of the Qualification type for the requirement.
        
                  - **Comparator** *(string) --* 
        
                    The kind of comparison to make against a Qualification\'s value. You can compare a Qualification\'s value to an IntegerValue to see if it is LessThan, LessThanOrEqualTo, GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the IntegerValue. You can compare it to a LocaleValue to see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue. You can check to see if the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or LocaleValue values. Lastly, a Qualification requirement can also test if a Qualification Exists or DoesNotExist in the user\'s profile, regardless of its value. 
        
                  - **IntegerValues** *(list) --* 
        
                    The integer value to compare against the Qualification\'s value. IntegerValue must not be present if Comparator is Exists or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can only be used if the Qualification type has an integer value; it cannot be used with the Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 15 IntegerValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure. 
        
                    - *(integer) --* 
                
                  - **LocaleValues** *(list) --* 
        
                    The locale value to compare against the Qualification\'s value. The local value must be a valid ISO 3166 country code or supports ISO 3166-2 subdivisions. LocaleValue can only be used with a Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. LocaleValue can only be used with the EqualTo, NotEqualTo, In, and NotIn comparators. You must only use a single LocaleValue element when using the EqualTo or NotEqualTo comparators. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 30 LocaleValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure. 
        
                    - *(dict) --* 
        
                      The Locale data structure represents a geographical region or location.
        
                      - **Country** *(string) --* 
        
                        The country of the locale. Must be a valid ISO 3166 country code. For example, the code US refers to the United States of America. 
        
                      - **Subdivision** *(string) --* 
        
                        The state or subdivision of the locale. A valid ISO 3166-2 subdivision code. For example, the code WA refers to the state of Washington.
        
                  - **RequiredToPreview** *(boolean) --* 
        
                    DEPRECATED: Use the ``ActionsGuarded`` field instead. If RequiredToPreview is true, the question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do not meet this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker\'s Qualifications must meet all of the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the HIT. If a Worker meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are no such requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT, the Worker will be allowed to preview the HIT\'s question data, but will not be allowed to accept and complete the HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in combination with the ``ActionsGuarded`` field.

                    Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include \"Accept\" (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their search results), \"PreviewAndAccept\" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can see the HIT in their search results), and \"DiscoverPreviewAndAccept\" (Worker cannot accept, preview, or see the HIT in their search results). It\'s possible for you to create a HIT with multiple QualificationRequirements (which can have different values for the ActionGuarded attribute). In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least restrictive to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet all requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or Accept the HIT. ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the ``RequiredToPreview`` field. 
        
              - **HITReviewStatus** *(string) --* 
        
                Indicates the review status of the HIT. Valid Values are NotReviewed | MarkedForReview | ReviewedAppropriate | ReviewedInappropriate.
        
              - **NumberOfAssignmentsPending** *(integer) --* 
        
                The number of assignments for this HIT that are being previewed or have been accepted by Workers, but have not yet been submitted, returned, or abandoned.
        
              - **NumberOfAssignmentsAvailable** *(integer) --* 
        
                The number of assignments for this HIT that are available for Workers to accept.
        
              - **NumberOfAssignmentsCompleted** *(integer) --* 
        
                The number of assignments for this HIT that have been approved or rejected.

        :param AssignmentDurationInSeconds: **[REQUIRED]** 
        
          The amount of time, in seconds, that a Worker has to complete the HIT after accepting it. If a Worker does not complete the assignment within the specified duration, the assignment is considered abandoned. If the HIT is still active (that is, its lifetime has not elapsed), the assignment becomes available for other users to find and accept. 
        
        :type Reward: string
        :param Reward: **[REQUIRED]** 
        
          The amount of money the Requester will pay a Worker for successfully completing the HIT. 
        
        :type Title: string
        :param Title: **[REQUIRED]** 
        
          The title of the HIT. A title should be short and descriptive about the kind of task the HIT contains. On the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, the HIT title appears in search results, and everywhere the HIT is mentioned. 
        
        :type Keywords: string
        :param Keywords: 
        
          One or more words or phrases that describe the HIT, separated by commas. These words are used in searches to find HITs. 
        
        :type Description: string
        :param Description: **[REQUIRED]** 
        
          A general description of the HIT. A description includes detailed information about the kind of task the HIT contains. On the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, the HIT description appears in the expanded view of search results, and in the HIT and assignment screens. A good description gives the user enough information to evaluate the HIT before accepting it. 
        
        :type QualificationRequirements: list
        :param QualificationRequirements: 
        
          Conditions that a Worker\'s Qualifications must meet in order to accept the HIT. A HIT can have between zero and ten Qualification requirements. All requirements must be met in order for a Worker to accept the HIT. Additionally, other actions can be restricted using the ``ActionsGuarded`` field on each ``QualificationRequirement`` structure. 
        
          - *(dict) --* 
        
            The QualificationRequirement data structure describes a Qualification that a Worker must have before the Worker is allowed to accept a HIT. A requirement may optionally state that a Worker must have the Qualification in order to preview the HIT, or see the HIT in search results. 
        
            - **QualificationTypeId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
              The ID of the Qualification type for the requirement.
        
            - **Comparator** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
              The kind of comparison to make against a Qualification\'s value. You can compare a Qualification\'s value to an IntegerValue to see if it is LessThan, LessThanOrEqualTo, GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the IntegerValue. You can compare it to a LocaleValue to see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue. You can check to see if the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or LocaleValue values. Lastly, a Qualification requirement can also test if a Qualification Exists or DoesNotExist in the user\'s profile, regardless of its value. 
        
            - **IntegerValues** *(list) --* 
        
              The integer value to compare against the Qualification\'s value. IntegerValue must not be present if Comparator is Exists or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can only be used if the Qualification type has an integer value; it cannot be used with the Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 15 IntegerValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure. 
        
              - *(integer) --* 
        
            - **LocaleValues** *(list) --* 
        
              The locale value to compare against the Qualification\'s value. The local value must be a valid ISO 3166 country code or supports ISO 3166-2 subdivisions. LocaleValue can only be used with a Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. LocaleValue can only be used with the EqualTo, NotEqualTo, In, and NotIn comparators. You must only use a single LocaleValue element when using the EqualTo or NotEqualTo comparators. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 30 LocaleValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure. 
        
              - *(dict) --* 
        
                The Locale data structure represents a geographical region or location.
        
                - **Country** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
                  The country of the locale. Must be a valid ISO 3166 country code. For example, the code US refers to the United States of America. 
        
                - **Subdivision** *(string) --* 
        
                  The state or subdivision of the locale. A valid ISO 3166-2 subdivision code. For example, the code WA refers to the state of Washington.
        
            - **RequiredToPreview** *(boolean) --* 
        
              DEPRECATED: Use the ``ActionsGuarded`` field instead. If RequiredToPreview is true, the question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do not meet this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker\'s Qualifications must meet all of the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the HIT. If a Worker meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are no such requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT, the Worker will be allowed to preview the HIT\'s question data, but will not be allowed to accept and complete the HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in combination with the ``ActionsGuarded`` field. 
        
            - **ActionsGuarded** *(string) --* 
        
              Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include \"Accept\" (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their search results), \"PreviewAndAccept\" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can see the HIT in their search results), and \"DiscoverPreviewAndAccept\" (Worker cannot accept, preview, or see the HIT in their search results). It\'s possible for you to create a HIT with multiple QualificationRequirements (which can have different values for the ActionGuarded attribute). In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least restrictive to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet all requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or Accept the HIT. ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the ``RequiredToPreview`` field.

          The RequesterAnnotation parameter for a HIT is only visible to the Requester who created the HIT. It is not shown to the Worker, or any other Requester. 
        
          The RequesterAnnotation parameter may be different for each HIT you submit. It does not affect how your HITs are grouped.

          A unique identifier for this request which allows you to retry the call on error without creating duplicate HITs. This is useful in cases such as network timeouts where it is unclear whether or not the call succeeded on the server. If the HIT already exists in the system from a previous call using the same UniqueRequestToken, subsequent calls will return a AWS.MechanicalTurk.HitAlreadyExists error with a message containing the HITId. 
        
          .. note::
        
            Note: It is your responsibility to ensure uniqueness of the token. The unique token expires after 24 hours. Subsequent calls using the same UniqueRequestToken made after the 24 hour limit could create duplicate HITs.

              - **Keywords** *(string) --* 
        
                One or more words or phrases that describe the HIT, separated by commas. Search terms similar to the keywords of a HIT are more likely to have the HIT in the search results.
        
              - **HITStatus** *(string) --* 
        
                The status of the HIT and its assignments. Valid Values are Assignable | Unassignable | Reviewable | Reviewing | Disposed. 
        
              - **MaxAssignments** *(integer) --* 
        
                The number of times the HIT can be accepted and completed before the HIT becomes unavailable.

                The amount of time, in seconds, after the Worker submits an assignment for the HIT that the results are automatically approved by Amazon Mechanical Turk. This is the amount of time the Requester has to reject an assignment submitted by a Worker before the assignment is auto-approved and the Worker is paid. 
        
              - **Expiration** *(datetime) --* 
        
                The date and time the HIT expires.
        
              - **AssignmentDurationInSeconds** *(integer) --* 
        
                The length of time, in seconds, that a Worker has to complete the HIT after accepting it.
        
              - **RequesterAnnotation** *(string) --* 
        
                An arbitrary data field the Requester who created the HIT can use. This field is visible only to the creator of the HIT.
        
              - **QualificationRequirements** *(list) --* 
        
                Conditions that a Worker\'s Qualifications must meet in order to accept the HIT. A HIT can have between zero and ten Qualification requirements. All requirements must be met in order for a Worker to accept the HIT. Additionally, other actions can be restricted using the ``ActionsGuarded`` field on each ``QualificationRequirement`` structure. 
        
                - *(dict) --* 
        
                  The QualificationRequirement data structure describes a Qualification that a Worker must have before the Worker is allowed to accept a HIT. A requirement may optionally state that a Worker must have the Qualification in order to preview the HIT, or see the HIT in search results. 
        
                  - **QualificationTypeId** *(string) --* 
        
                    The ID of the Qualification type for the requirement.
        
                  - **Comparator** *(string) --* 
        
                    The kind of comparison to make against a Qualification\'s value. You can compare a Qualification\'s value to an IntegerValue to see if it is LessThan, LessThanOrEqualTo, GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the IntegerValue. You can compare it to a LocaleValue to see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue. You can check to see if the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or LocaleValue values. Lastly, a Qualification requirement can also test if a Qualification Exists or DoesNotExist in the user\'s profile, regardless of its value. 
        
                  - **IntegerValues** *(list) --* 
        
                    The integer value to compare against the Qualification\'s value. IntegerValue must not be present if Comparator is Exists or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can only be used if the Qualification type has an integer value; it cannot be used with the Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 15 IntegerValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure. 
        
                    - *(integer) --* 
                
                  - **LocaleValues** *(list) --* 
        
                    The locale value to compare against the Qualification\'s value. The local value must be a valid ISO 3166 country code or supports ISO 3166-2 subdivisions. LocaleValue can only be used with a Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. LocaleValue can only be used with the EqualTo, NotEqualTo, In, and NotIn comparators. You must only use a single LocaleValue element when using the EqualTo or NotEqualTo comparators. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 30 LocaleValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure. 
        
                    - *(dict) --* 
        
                      The Locale data structure represents a geographical region or location.
        
                      - **Country** *(string) --* 
        
                        The country of the locale. Must be a valid ISO 3166 country code. For example, the code US refers to the United States of America. 
        
                      - **Subdivision** *(string) --* 
        
                        The state or subdivision of the locale. A valid ISO 3166-2 subdivision code. For example, the code WA refers to the state of Washington.
        
                  - **RequiredToPreview** *(boolean) --* 
        
                    DEPRECATED: Use the ``ActionsGuarded`` field instead. If RequiredToPreview is true, the question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do not meet this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker\'s Qualifications must meet all of the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the HIT. If a Worker meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are no such requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT, the Worker will be allowed to preview the HIT\'s question data, but will not be allowed to accept and complete the HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in combination with the ``ActionsGuarded`` field. 
        
                  - **ActionsGuarded** *(string) --* 
        
                    Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include \"Accept\" (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their search results), \"PreviewAndAccept\" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can see the HIT in their search results), and \"DiscoverPreviewAndAccept\" (Worker cannot accept, preview, or see the HIT in their search results). It\'s possible for you to create a HIT with multiple QualificationRequirements (which can have different values for the ActionGuarded attribute). In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least restrictive to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet all requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or Accept the HIT. ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the ``RequiredToPreview`` field. 
        
              - **HITReviewStatus** *(string) --* 
        
                Indicates the review status of the HIT. Valid Values are NotReviewed | MarkedForReview | ReviewedAppropriate | ReviewedInappropriate.
        
              - **NumberOfAssignmentsPending** *(integer) --* 
        
                The number of assignments for this HIT that are being previewed or have been accepted by Workers, but have not yet been submitted, returned, or abandoned.
        
              - **NumberOfAssignmentsAvailable** *(integer) --* 
        
                The number of assignments for this HIT that are available for Workers to accept.
        
              - **NumberOfAssignmentsCompleted** *(integer) --* 
        
                The number of assignments for this HIT that have been approved or rejected.

              The created Qualification type, returned as a QualificationType data structure.
        
              - **QualificationTypeId** *(string) --* 
        
                A unique identifier for the Qualification type. A Qualification type is given a Qualification type ID when you call the CreateQualificationType operation. 
        
              - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 
        
                The date and time the Qualification type was created. 
        
              - **Name** *(string) --* 
        
                The name of the Qualification type. The type name is used to identify the type, and to find the type using a Qualification type search. 
        
              - **Description** *(string) --* 
        
                A long description for the Qualification type. 
        
              - **Keywords** *(string) --* 
        
                One or more words or phrases that describe theQualification type, separated by commas. The Keywords make the type easier to find using a search. 
        
              - **QualificationTypeStatus** *(string) --* 
        
                The status of the Qualification type. A Qualification type\'s status determines if users can apply to receive a Qualification of this type, and if HITs can be created with requirements based on this type. Valid values are Active | Inactive. 
        
              - **Test** *(string) --* 
        
                The questions for a Qualification test associated with this Qualification type that a user can take to obtain a Qualification of this type. This parameter must be specified if AnswerKey is present. A Qualification type cannot have both a specified Test parameter and an AutoGranted value of true. 
        
              - **TestDurationInSeconds** *(integer) --* 
        
                The amount of time, in seconds, given to a Worker to complete the Qualification test, beginning from the time the Worker requests the Qualification. 
        
              - **AnswerKey** *(string) --* 
        
                The answers to the Qualification test specified in the Test parameter.
        
              - **RetryDelayInSeconds** *(integer) --* 
        
                The amount of time, in seconds, Workers must wait after taking the Qualification test before they can take it again. Workers can take a Qualification test multiple times if they were not granted the Qualification from a previous attempt, or if the test offers a gradient score and they want a better score. If not specified, retries are disabled and Workers can request a Qualification only once. 
        
              - **IsRequestable** *(boolean) --* 
        
                Specifies whether the Qualification type is one that a user can request through the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, such as by taking a Qualification test. This value is False for Qualifications assigned automatically by the system. Valid values are True | False. 
        
              - **AutoGranted** *(boolean) --* 
        
                Specifies that requests for the Qualification type are granted immediately, without prompting the Worker with a Qualification test. Valid values are True | False.
        
              - **AutoGrantedValue** *(integer) --* 
        
                The Qualification integer value to use for automatically granted Qualifications, if AutoGranted is true. This is 1 by default.

                One or more words or phrases that describe the HIT, separated by commas. Search terms similar to the keywords of a HIT are more likely to have the HIT in the search results.
        
              - **HITStatus** *(string) --* 
        
                The status of the HIT and its assignments. Valid Values are Assignable | Unassignable | Reviewable | Reviewing | Disposed.

              - **AutoApprovalDelayInSeconds** *(integer) --* 
        
                The amount of time, in seconds, after the Worker submits an assignment for the HIT that the results are automatically approved by Amazon Mechanical Turk. This is the amount of time the Requester has to reject an assignment submitted by a Worker before the assignment is auto-approved and the Worker is paid. 
        
              - **Expiration** *(datetime) --* 
        
                The date and time the HIT expires.
        
              - **AssignmentDurationInSeconds** *(integer) --* 
        
                The length of time, in seconds, that a Worker has to complete the HIT after accepting it.
        
              - **RequesterAnnotation** *(string) --* 
        
                An arbitrary data field the Requester who created the HIT can use. This field is visible only to the creator of the HIT.
        
              - **QualificationRequirements** *(list) --* 
        
                Conditions that a Worker\'s Qualifications must meet in order to accept the HIT. A HIT can have between zero and ten Qualification requirements. All requirements must be met in order for a Worker to accept the HIT. Additionally, other actions can be restricted using the ``ActionsGuarded`` field on each ``QualificationRequirement`` structure. 
        
                - *(dict) --* 
        
                  The QualificationRequirement data structure describes a Qualification that a Worker must have before the Worker is allowed to accept a HIT. A requirement may optionally state that a Worker must have the Qualification in order to preview the HIT, or see the HIT in search results. 
        
                  - **QualificationTypeId** *(string) --* 
        
                    The ID of the Qualification type for the requirement.
        
                  - **Comparator** *(string) --* 
        
                    The kind of comparison to make against a Qualification\'s value. You can compare a Qualification\'s value to an IntegerValue to see if it is LessThan, LessThanOrEqualTo, GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the IntegerValue. You can compare it to a LocaleValue to see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue. You can check to see if the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or LocaleValue values. Lastly, a Qualification requirement can also test if a Qualification Exists or DoesNotExist in the user\'s profile, regardless of its value. 
        
                  - **IntegerValues** *(list) --* 
        
                    The integer value to compare against the Qualification\'s value. IntegerValue must not be present if Comparator is Exists or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can only be used if the Qualification type has an integer value; it cannot be used with the Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 15 IntegerValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure. 
        
                    - *(integer) --* 
                
                  - **LocaleValues** *(list) --* 
        
                    The locale value to compare against the Qualification\'s value. The local value must be a valid ISO 3166 country code or supports ISO 3166-2 subdivisions. LocaleValue can only be used with a Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. LocaleValue can only be used with the EqualTo, NotEqualTo, In, and NotIn comparators. You must only use a single LocaleValue element when using the EqualTo or NotEqualTo comparators. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 30 LocaleValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure. 
        
                    - *(dict) --* 
        
                      The Locale data structure represents a geographical region or location.
        
                      - **Country** *(string) --* 
        
                        The country of the locale. Must be a valid ISO 3166 country code. For example, the code US refers to the United States of America. 
        
                      - **Subdivision** *(string) --* 
        
                        The state or subdivision of the locale. A valid ISO 3166-2 subdivision code. For example, the code WA refers to the state of Washington.
        
                  - **RequiredToPreview** *(boolean) --* 
        
                    DEPRECATED: Use the ``ActionsGuarded`` field instead. If RequiredToPreview is true, the question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do not meet this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker\'s Qualifications must meet all of the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the HIT. If a Worker meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are no such requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT, the Worker will be allowed to preview the HIT\'s question data, but will not be allowed to accept and complete the HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in combination with the ``ActionsGuarded`` field. 
        
                  - **ActionsGuarded** *(string) --* 
        
                    Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include \"Accept\" (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their search results), \"PreviewAndAccept\" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can see the HIT in their search results), and \"DiscoverPreviewAndAccept\" (Worker cannot accept, preview, or see the HIT in their search results). It\'s possible for you to create a HIT with multiple QualificationRequirements (which can have different values for the ActionGuarded attribute). In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least restrictive to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet all requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or Accept the HIT. ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the ``RequiredToPreview`` field. 
        
              - **HITReviewStatus** *(string) --* 
        
                Indicates the review status of the HIT. Valid Values are NotReviewed | MarkedForReview | ReviewedAppropriate | ReviewedInappropriate.
        
              - **NumberOfAssignmentsPending** *(integer) --* 
        
                The number of assignments for this HIT that are being previewed or have been accepted by Workers, but have not yet been submitted, returned, or abandoned.
        
              - **NumberOfAssignmentsAvailable** *(integer) --* 
        
                The number of assignments for this HIT that are available for Workers to accept.
        
              - **NumberOfAssignmentsCompleted** *(integer) --* 
        
                The number of assignments for this HIT that have been approved or rejected.

                  - **QualificationTypeId** *(string) --* 
        
                    The ID of the Qualification type for the requirement.
        
                  - **Comparator** *(string) --* 
        
                    The kind of comparison to make against a Qualification\'s value. You can compare a Qualification\'s value to an IntegerValue to see if it is LessThan, LessThanOrEqualTo, GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the IntegerValue. You can compare it to a LocaleValue to see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue. You can check to see if the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or LocaleValue values. Lastly, a Qualification requirement can also test if a Qualification Exists or DoesNotExist in the user\'s profile, regardless of its value. 
        
                  - **IntegerValues** *(list) --* 
        
                    The integer value to compare against the Qualification\'s value. IntegerValue must not be present if Comparator is Exists or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can only be used if the Qualification type has an integer value; it cannot be used with the Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 15 IntegerValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure. 
        
                    - *(integer) --* 
                
                  - **LocaleValues** *(list) --* 
        
                    The locale value to compare against the Qualification\'s value. The local value must be a valid ISO 3166 country code or supports ISO 3166-2 subdivisions. LocaleValue can only be used with a Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. LocaleValue can only be used with the EqualTo, NotEqualTo, In, and NotIn comparators. You must only use a single LocaleValue element when using the EqualTo or NotEqualTo comparators. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 30 LocaleValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure. 
        
                    - *(dict) --* 
        
                      The Locale data structure represents a geographical region or location.
        
                      - **Country** *(string) --* 
        
                        The country of the locale. Must be a valid ISO 3166 country code. For example, the code US refers to the United States of America. 
        
                      - **Subdivision** *(string) --* 
        
                        The state or subdivision of the locale. A valid ISO 3166-2 subdivision code. For example, the code WA refers to the state of Washington.
        
                  - **RequiredToPreview** *(boolean) --* 
        
                    DEPRECATED: Use the ``ActionsGuarded`` field instead. If RequiredToPreview is true, the question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do not meet this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker\'s Qualifications must meet all of the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the HIT. If a Worker meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are no such requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT, the Worker will be allowed to preview the HIT\'s question data, but will not be allowed to accept and complete the HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in combination with the ``ActionsGuarded`` field. 
        
                  - **ActionsGuarded** *(string) --* 
        
                    Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include \"Accept\" (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their search results), \"PreviewAndAccept\" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can see the HIT in their search results), and \"DiscoverPreviewAndAccept\" (Worker cannot accept, preview, or see the HIT in their search results). It\'s possible for you to create a HIT with multiple QualificationRequirements (which can have different values for the ActionGuarded attribute). In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least restrictive to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet all requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or Accept the HIT. ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the ``RequiredToPreview`` field. 
        
              - **HITReviewStatus** *(string) --* 
        
                Indicates the review status of the HIT. Valid Values are NotReviewed | MarkedForReview | ReviewedAppropriate | ReviewedInappropriate.
        
              - **NumberOfAssignmentsPending** *(integer) --* 
        
                The number of assignments for this HIT that are being previewed or have been accepted by Workers, but have not yet been submitted, returned, or abandoned.
        
              - **NumberOfAssignmentsAvailable** *(integer) --* 
        
                The number of assignments for this HIT that are available for Workers to accept.
        
              - **NumberOfAssignmentsCompleted** *(integer) --* 
        
                The number of assignments for this HIT that have been approved or rejected.

                - **AutoApprovalTime** *(datetime) --* 
        
                  If results have been submitted, AutoApprovalTime is the date and time the results of the assignment results are considered Approved automatically if they have not already been explicitly approved or rejected by the Requester. This value is derived from the auto-approval delay specified by the Requester in the HIT. This value is omitted from the assignment if the Worker has not yet submitted results.
        
                - **AcceptTime** *(datetime) --* 
        
                  The date and time the Worker accepted the assignment.
        
                - **SubmitTime** *(datetime) --* 
        
                  If the Worker has submitted results, SubmitTime is the date and time the assignment was submitted. This value is omitted from the assignment if the Worker has not yet submitted results.
        
                - **ApprovalTime** *(datetime) --* 
        
                  If the Worker has submitted results and the Requester has approved the results, ApprovalTime is the date and time the Requester approved the results. This value is omitted from the assignment if the Requester has not yet approved the results.
        
                - **RejectionTime** *(datetime) --* 
        
                  If the Worker has submitted results and the Requester has rejected the results, RejectionTime is the date and time the Requester rejected the results.
        
                - **Deadline** *(datetime) --* 
        
                  The date and time of the deadline for the assignment. This value is derived from the deadline specification for the HIT and the date and time the Worker accepted the HIT.
        
                - **Answer** *(string) --* 
        
                  The Worker\'s answers submitted for the HIT contained in a QuestionFormAnswers document, if the Worker provides an answer. If the Worker does not provide any answers, Answer may contain a QuestionFormAnswers document, or Answer may be empty.
        
                - **RequesterFeedback** *(string) --* 
        
                  The feedback string included with the call to the ApproveAssignment operation or the RejectAssignment operation, if the Requester approved or rejected the assignment and specified feedback.

You can compare a Qualification\'s value to an IntegerValue to see if it is LessThan, LessThanOrEqualTo, GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the IntegerValue. You can compare it to a LocaleValue to see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue. You can check to see if the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or LocaleValue values. Lastly, a Qualification requirement can also test if a Qualification Exists or DoesNotExist in the user\'s profile, regardless of its value. 
        
                    - **IntegerValues** *(list) --* 
        
                      The integer value to compare against the Qualification\'s value. IntegerValue must not be present if Comparator is Exists or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can only be used if the Qualification type has an integer value; it cannot be used with the Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 15 IntegerValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure. 
        
                      - *(integer) --*

                      The locale value to compare against the Qualification\'s value. The local value must be a valid ISO 3166 country code or supports ISO 3166-2 subdivisions. LocaleValue can only be used with a Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. LocaleValue can only be used with the EqualTo, NotEqualTo, In, and NotIn comparators. You must only use a single LocaleValue element when using the EqualTo or NotEqualTo comparators. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 30 LocaleValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure. 
        
                      - *(dict) --* 
        
                        The Locale data structure represents a geographical region or location.
        
                        - **Country** *(string) --*

That is, a Worker\'s Qualifications must meet all of the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the HIT. If a Worker meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are no such requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT, the Worker will be allowed to preview the HIT\'s question data, but will not be allowed to accept and complete the HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in combination with the ``ActionsGuarded`` field.

Valid arguments include \"Accept\" (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their search results), \"PreviewAndAccept\" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can see the HIT in their search results), and \"DiscoverPreviewAndAccept\" (Worker cannot accept, preview, or see the HIT in their search results). It\'s possible for you to create a HIT with multiple QualificationRequirements (which can have different values for the ActionGuarded attribute). In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least restrictive to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet all requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or Accept the HIT.

                  Conditions that a Worker\'s Qualifications must meet in order to accept the HIT. A HIT can have between zero and ten Qualification requirements. All requirements must be met in order for a Worker to accept the HIT. Additionally, other actions can be restricted using the ``ActionsGuarded`` field on each ``QualificationRequirement`` structure. 
        
                  - *(dict) --* 
        
                    The QualificationRequirement data structure describes a Qualification that a Worker must have before the Worker is allowed to accept a HIT.

You can compare a Qualification\'s value to an IntegerValue to see if it is LessThan, LessThanOrEqualTo, GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the IntegerValue. You can compare it to a LocaleValue to see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue. You can check to see if the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or LocaleValue values. Lastly, a Qualification requirement can also test if a Qualification Exists or DoesNotExist in the user\'s profile, regardless of its value. 
        
                    - **IntegerValues** *(list) --* 
        
                      The integer value to compare against the Qualification\'s value. IntegerValue must not be present if Comparator is Exists or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can only be used if the Qualification type has an integer value; it cannot be used with the Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 15 IntegerValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure. 
        
                      - *(integer) --*

LocaleValue can only be used with a Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. LocaleValue can only be used with the EqualTo, NotEqualTo, In, and NotIn comparators. You must only use a single LocaleValue element when using the EqualTo or NotEqualTo comparators. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 30 LocaleValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure. 
        
                      - *(dict) --*

              - *(dict) --* 
        
                The QualificationType data structure represents a Qualification type, a description of a property of a Worker that must match the requirements of a HIT for the Worker to be able to accept the HIT. The type also describes how a Worker can obtain a Qualification of that type, such as through a Qualification test. 
        
                - **QualificationTypeId** *(string) --* 
        
                  A unique identifier for the Qualification type. A Qualification type is given a Qualification type ID when you call the CreateQualificationType operation. 
        
                - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 
        
                  The date and time the Qualification type was created.

                  The amount of time, in seconds, Workers must wait after taking the Qualification test before they can take it again. Workers can take a Qualification test multiple times if they were not granted the Qualification from a previous attempt, or if the test offers a gradient score and they want a better score. If not specified, retries are disabled and Workers can request a Qualification only once. 
        
                - **IsRequestable** *(boolean) --* 
        
                  Specifies whether the Qualification type is one that a user can request through the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, such as by taking a Qualification test. This value is False for Qualifications assigned automatically by the system. Valid values are True | False.

                  One or more words or phrases that describe the HIT, separated by commas. Search terms similar to the keywords of a HIT are more likely to have the HIT in the search results.
        
                - **HITStatus** *(string) --* 
        
                  The status of the HIT and its assignments. Valid Values are Assignable | Unassignable | Reviewable | Reviewing | Disposed.

                  The amount of time, in seconds, after the Worker submits an assignment for the HIT that the results are automatically approved by Amazon Mechanical Turk. This is the amount of time the Requester has to reject an assignment submitted by a Worker before the assignment is auto-approved and the Worker is paid. 
        
                - **Expiration** *(datetime) --* 
        
                  The date and time the HIT expires.
        
                - **AssignmentDurationInSeconds** *(integer) --* 
        
                  The length of time, in seconds, that a Worker has to complete the HIT after accepting it.
        
                - **RequesterAnnotation** *(string) --* 
        
                  An arbitrary data field the Requester who created the HIT can use. This field is visible only to the creator of the HIT.
        
                - **QualificationRequirements** *(list) --* 
        
                  Conditions that a Worker\'s Qualifications must meet in order to accept the HIT. A HIT can have between zero and ten Qualification requirements. All requirements must be met in order for a Worker to accept the HIT. Additionally, other actions can be restricted using the ``ActionsGuarded`` field on each ``QualificationRequirement`` structure. 
        
                  - *(dict) --* 
        
                    The QualificationRequirement data structure describes a Qualification that a Worker must have before the Worker is allowed to accept a HIT. A requirement may optionally state that a Worker must have the Qualification in order to preview the HIT, or see the HIT in search results. 
        
                    - **QualificationTypeId** *(string) --* 
        
                      The ID of the Qualification type for the requirement.
        
                    - **Comparator** *(string) --* 
        
                      The kind of comparison to make against a Qualification\'s value. You can compare a Qualification\'s value to an IntegerValue to see if it is LessThan, LessThanOrEqualTo, GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the IntegerValue. You can compare it to a LocaleValue to see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue. You can check to see if the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or LocaleValue values. Lastly, a Qualification requirement can also test if a Qualification Exists or DoesNotExist in the user\'s profile, regardless of its value. 
        
                    - **IntegerValues** *(list) --* 
        
                      The integer value to compare against the Qualification\'s value. IntegerValue must not be present if Comparator is Exists or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can only be used if the Qualification type has an integer value; it cannot be used with the Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 15 IntegerValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure. 
        
                      - *(integer) --* 
                  
                    - **LocaleValues** *(list) --* 
        
                      The locale value to compare against the Qualification\'s value. The local value must be a valid ISO 3166 country code or supports ISO 3166-2 subdivisions. LocaleValue can only be used with a Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. LocaleValue can only be used with the EqualTo, NotEqualTo, In, and NotIn comparators. You must only use a single LocaleValue element when using the EqualTo or NotEqualTo comparators. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 30 LocaleValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure. 
        
                      - *(dict) --* 
        
                        The Locale data structure represents a geographical region or location.
        
                        - **Country** *(string) --* 
        
                          The country of the locale. Must be a valid ISO 3166 country code. For example, the code US refers to the United States of America. 
        
                        - **Subdivision** *(string) --* 
        
                          The state or subdivision of the locale. A valid ISO 3166-2 subdivision code. For example, the code WA refers to the state of Washington.
        
                    - **RequiredToPreview** *(boolean) --* 
        
                      DEPRECATED: Use the ``ActionsGuarded`` field instead. If RequiredToPreview is true, the question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do not meet this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker\'s Qualifications must meet all of the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the HIT. If a Worker meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are no such requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT, the Worker will be allowed to preview the HIT\'s question data, but will not be allowed to accept and complete the HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in combination with the ``ActionsGuarded`` field. 
        
                    - **ActionsGuarded** *(string) --* 
        
                      Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include \"Accept\" (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their search results), \"PreviewAndAccept\" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can see the HIT in their search results), and \"DiscoverPreviewAndAccept\" (Worker cannot accept, preview, or see the HIT in their search results). It\'s possible for you to create a HIT with multiple QualificationRequirements (which can have different values for the ActionGuarded attribute). In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least restrictive to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet all requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or Accept the HIT. ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the ``RequiredToPreview`` field. 
        
                - **HITReviewStatus** *(string) --* 
        
                  Indicates the review status of the HIT. Valid Values are NotReviewed | MarkedForReview | ReviewedAppropriate | ReviewedInappropriate.
        
                - **NumberOfAssignmentsPending** *(integer) --* 
        
                  The number of assignments for this HIT that are being previewed or have been accepted by Workers, but have not yet been submitted, returned, or abandoned.
        
                - **NumberOfAssignmentsAvailable** *(integer) --* 
        
                  The number of assignments for this HIT that are available for Workers to accept.
        
                - **NumberOfAssignmentsCompleted** *(integer) --* 
        
                  The number of assignments for this HIT that have been approved or rejected.

        :param TestDurationInSeconds: 
        
          The number of seconds the Worker has to complete the Qualification test, starting from the time the Worker requests the Qualification.
        
        :type RetryDelayInSeconds: integer
        :param RetryDelayInSeconds: 
        
          The amount of time, in seconds, that Workers must wait after requesting a Qualification of the specified Qualification type before they can retry the Qualification request. It is not possible to disable retries for a Qualification type after it has been created with retries enabled. If you want to disable retries, you must dispose of the existing retry-enabled Qualification type using DisposeQualificationType and then create a new Qualification type with retries disabled using CreateQualificationType.
        
        :type AutoGranted: boolean
        :param AutoGranted: 
        
          Specifies whether requests for the Qualification type are granted immediately, without prompting the Worker with a Qualification test.
        
          Constraints: If the Test parameter is specified, this parameter cannot be true.
        
        :type AutoGrantedValue: integer
        :param AutoGrantedValue: 
        
          The Qualification value to use for automatically granted Qualifications. This parameter is used only if the AutoGranted parameter is true.

          - *(dict) --* 
            
            - **QualificationType** *(dict) --* 
        
              Contains a QualificationType data structure.
        
              - **QualificationTypeId** *(string) --* 
        
                A unique identifier for the Qualification type. A Qualification type is given a Qualification type ID when you call the CreateQualificationType operation. 
        
              - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 
        
                The date and time the Qualification type was created. 
        
              - **Name** *(string) --* 
        
                The name of the Qualification type. The type name is used to identify the type, and to find the type using a Qualification type search. 
        
              - **Description** *(string) --* 
        
                A long description for the Qualification type. 
        
              - **Keywords** *(string) --* 
        
                One or more words or phrases that describe theQualification type, separated by commas. The Keywords make the type easier to find using a search. 
        
              - **QualificationTypeStatus** *(string) --* 
        
                The status of the Qualification type. A Qualification type\'s status determines if users can apply to receive a Qualification of this type, and if HITs can be created with requirements based on this type. Valid values are Active | Inactive. 
        
              - **Test** *(string) --* 
        
                The questions for a Qualification test associated with this Qualification type that a user can take to obtain a Qualification of this type. This parameter must be specified if AnswerKey is present. A Qualification type cannot have both a specified Test parameter and an AutoGranted value of true. 
        
              - **TestDurationInSeconds** *(integer) --* 
        
                The amount of time, in seconds, given to a Worker to complete the Qualification test, beginning from the time the Worker requests the Qualification. 
        
              - **AnswerKey** *(string) --* 
        
                The answers to the Qualification test specified in the Test parameter.
        
              - **RetryDelayInSeconds** *(integer) --* 
        
                The amount of time, in seconds, Workers must wait after taking the Qualification test before they can take it again. Workers can take a Qualification test multiple times if they were not granted the Qualification from a previous attempt, or if the test offers a gradient score and they want a better score. If not specified, retries are disabled and Workers can request a Qualification only once. 
        
              - **IsRequestable** *(boolean) --* 
        
                Specifies whether the Qualification type is one that a user can request through the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, such as by taking a Qualification test. This value is False for Qualifications assigned automatically by the system. Valid values are True | False. 
        
              - **AutoGranted** *(boolean) --* 
        
                Specifies that requests for the Qualification type are granted immediately, without prompting the Worker with a Qualification test. Valid values are True | False.
        
              - **AutoGrantedValue** *(integer) --* 
        
                The Qualification integer value to use for automatically granted Qualifications, if AutoGranted is true. This is 1 by default.
