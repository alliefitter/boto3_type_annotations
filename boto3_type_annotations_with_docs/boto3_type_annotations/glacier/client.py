For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see `Computing Checksums <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html>`__ . On the server side, Amazon Glacier also constructs the SHA256 tree hash of the assembled archive. If the values match, Amazon Glacier saves the archive to the vault; otherwise, it returns an error, and the operation fails. The  ListParts operation returns a list of parts uploaded for a specific multipart upload. It includes checksum information for each uploaded part that can be used to debug a bad checksum issue.
        
        Additionally, Amazon Glacier also checks for any missing content ranges when assembling the archive, if missing content ranges are found, Amazon Glacier returns an error and the operation fails.
        
        Complete Multipart Upload is an idempotent operation. After your first successful complete multipart upload, if you call the operation again within a short period, the operation will succeed and return the same archive ID. This is useful in the event you experience a network issue that causes an aborted connection or receive a 500 server error, in which case you can repeat your Complete Multipart Upload request and get the same archive ID without creating duplicate archives. Note, however, that after the multipart upload completes, you cannot call the List Parts operation and the multipart upload will not appear in List Multipart Uploads response, even if idempotent complete is possible.

              The SHA256 tree hash value for the requested range of an archive. If the **InitiateJob** request for an archive specified a tree-hash aligned range, then this field returns a value.
        
              If the whole archive is retrieved, this value is the same as the ArchiveSHA256TreeHash value.
        
              This field is null for the following:
        
              * Archive retrieval jobs that specify a range that is not tree-hash aligned 
               
              * Archival jobs that specify a range that is equal to the whole archive, when the job status is ``InProgress``   
               
              * Inventory jobs 
               
              * Select jobs 
               
            - **ArchiveSHA256TreeHash** *(string) --*

              The retrieved byte range for archive retrieval jobs in the form *StartByteValue* -*EndByteValue* . If no range was specified in the archive retrieval, then the whole archive is retrieved. In this case, *StartByteValue* equals 0 and *EndByteValue* equals the size of the archive minus 1. For inventory retrieval or select jobs, this field is null. 
        
            - **Tier** *(string) --* 
        
              The tier to use for a select or an archive retrieval. Valid values are ``Expedited`` , ``Standard`` , or ``Bulk`` . ``Standard`` is the default.

You use the following process to download the job output:

          * After downloading all the parts of the job output, you have a list of eight checksum values. Compute the tree hash of these values to find the checksum of the entire output. Using the  DescribeJob API, obtain job information of the job that provided you the output. The response includes the checksum of the entire archive stored in Amazon Glacier. You compare this value with the checksum you computed to ensure you have downloaded the entire archive content with no errors.

              The job data, either archive data or inventory data.
        
            - **checksum** *(string) --* 
        
              The checksum of the data in the response. This header is returned only when retrieving the output for an archive retrieval job. Furthermore, this header appears only under the following conditions:
        
              * You get the entire range of the archive. 
               
              * You request a range to return of the archive that starts and ends on a multiple of 1 MB. For example, if you have an 3.1 MB archive and you specify a range to return that starts at 1 MB and ends at 2 MB, then the x-amz-sha256-tree-hash is returned as a response header. 
               
              * You request a range of the archive to return that starts on a multiple of 1 MB and goes to the end of the archive. For example, if you have a 3.1 MB archive and you specify a range that starts at 2 MB and ends at 3.1 MB (the end of the archive), then the x-amz-sha256-tree-hash is returned as a response header. 
               
            - **status** *(integer) --* 
        
              The HTTP response code for a job output request. The value depends on whether a range was specified in the request.
        
            - **contentRange** *(string) --* 
        
              The range of bytes returned by Amazon Glacier. If only partial output is downloaded, the response provides the range of bytes Amazon Glacier returned. For example, bytes 0-1048575/8388608 returns the first 1 MB from 8 MB.
        
            - **acceptRanges** *(string) --* 
        
              Indicates the range units accepted. For more information, see `RFC2616 <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html>`__ . 
        
            - **contentType** *(string) --* 
        
              The Content-Type depends on whether the job output is an archive or a vault inventory. For archive data, the Content-Type is application/octet-stream. For vault inventory, if you requested CSV format when you initiated the job, the Content-Type is text/csv. Otherwise, by default, vault inventory is returned as JSON, and the Content-Type is application/json.
        
            - **archiveDescription** *(string) --* 
        
              The description of an archive.

        When you initiate a multipart upload, you specify the part size in number of bytes. The part size must be a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied by a power of 2-for example, 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB), 4194304 (4 MB), 8388608 (8 MB), and so on. The minimum allowable part size is 1 MB, and the maximum is 4 GB.
        
        Every part you upload to this resource (see  UploadMultipartPart ), except the last one, must have the same size. The last one can be the same size or smaller. For example, suppose you want to upload a 16.2 MB file. If you initiate the multipart upload with a part size of 4 MB, you will upload four parts of 4 MB each and one part of 0.2 MB. 
        
        .. note::
        
          You don\'t need to know the size of the archive when you start a multipart upload because Amazon Glacier does not require you to specify the overall archive size.
        
        After you complete the multipart upload, Amazon Glacier removes the multipart upload resource referenced by the ID. Amazon Glacier also removes the multipart upload resource if you cancel the multipart upload or it may be removed if there is no activity for a period of 24 hours.
        
        An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don\'t have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.

        You must complete the vault locking process within 24 hours after the vault lock enters the ``InProgress`` state. After the 24 hour window ends, the lock ID expires, the vault automatically exits the ``InProgress`` state, and the vault lock policy is removed from the vault. You call  CompleteVaultLock to complete the vault locking process by setting the state of the vault lock to ``Locked`` . 
        
        After a vault lock is in the ``Locked`` state, you cannot initiate a new vault lock for the vault.

        .. note::
        
          Amazon Glacier retains recently completed jobs for a period before deleting them; however, it eventually removes completed jobs. The output of completed jobs can be retrieved. Retaining completed jobs for a period of time after they have completed enables you to get a job output in the event you miss the job completion notification or your first attempt to download it fails. For example, suppose you start an archive retrieval job to download an archive. After the job completes, you start to download the archive but encounter a network error. In this scenario, you can retry and download the archive while the job exists.
        
        The List Jobs operation supports pagination. You should always check the response ``Marker`` field. If there are no more jobs to list, the ``Marker`` field is set to ``null`` . If there are more jobs to list, the ``Marker`` field is set to a non-null value, which you can use to continue the pagination of the list. To return a list of jobs that begins at a specific job, set the marker request parameter to the ``Marker`` value for that job that you obtained from a previous List Jobs request.
        
        You can set a maximum limit for the number of jobs returned in the response by specifying the ``limit`` parameter in the request. The default limit is 50. The number of jobs returned might be fewer than the limit, but the number of returned jobs never exceeds the limit.
        
        Additionally, you can filter the jobs list returned by specifying the optional ``statuscode`` parameter or ``completed`` parameter, or both. Using the ``statuscode`` parameter, you can specify to return only jobs that match either the ``InProgress`` , ``Succeeded`` , or ``Failed`` status. Using the ``completed`` parameter, you can specify to return only jobs that were completed (``true`` ) or jobs that were not completed (``false`` ).

        The List Multipart Uploads operation supports pagination. By default, this operation returns up to 50 multipart uploads in the response. You should always check the response for a ``marker`` at which to continue the list; if there are no more items the ``marker`` is ``null`` . To return a list of multipart uploads that begins at a specific upload, set the ``marker`` request parameter to the value you obtained from a previous List Multipart Upload request. You can also limit the number of uploads returned in the response by specifying the ``limit`` parameter in the request.
        
        Note the difference between this operation and listing parts ( ListParts ). The List Multipart Uploads operation lists all multipart uploads for a vault and does not require a multipart upload ID. The List Parts operation requires a multipart upload ID since parts are associated with a single upload.
        
        An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don\'t have any permissions by default.

        To configure vault notifications, send a PUT request to the ``notification-configuration`` subresource of the vault. The request should include a JSON document that provides an Amazon SNS topic and specific events for which you want Amazon Glacier to send notifications to the topic.
        
        Amazon SNS topics must grant permission to the vault to be allowed to publish notifications to the topic. You can configure a vault to publish a notification for the following vault events:
        
        * **ArchiveRetrievalCompleted** This event occurs when a job that was initiated for an archive retrieval is completed ( InitiateJob ). The status of the completed job can be \"Succeeded\" or \"Failed\". The notification sent to the SNS topic is the same output as returned from  DescribeJob .  
         
        * **InventoryRetrievalCompleted** This event occurs when a job that was initiated for an inventory retrieval is completed ( InitiateJob ). The status of the completed job can be \"Succeeded\" or \"Failed\". The notification sent to the SNS topic is the same output as returned from  DescribeJob .  
         
        An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don\'t have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.

        Amazon Glacier rejects your upload part request if any of the following conditions is true:
        
        * **SHA256 tree hash does not match** To ensure that part data is not corrupted in transmission, you compute a SHA256 tree hash of the part and include it in your request. Upon receiving the part data, Amazon Glacier also computes a SHA256 tree hash. If these hash values don\'t match, the operation fails. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see `Computing Checksums <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html>`__ . 
         
        * **Part size does not match** The size of each part except the last must match the size specified in the corresponding  InitiateMultipartUpload request. The size of the last part must be the same size as, or smaller than, the specified size. 
        
        .. note::
        
           If you upload a part whose size is smaller than the part size you specified in your initiate multipart upload request and that part is not the last part, then the upload part request will succeed. However, the subsequent Complete Multipart Upload request will fail. 
        
        * **Range does not align** The byte range value in the request does not align with the part size specified in the corresponding initiate request. For example, if you specify a part size of 4194304 bytes (4 MB), then 0 to 4194303 bytes (4 MB - 1) and 4194304 (4 MB) to 8388607 (8 MB - 1) are valid part ranges. However, if you set a range value of 2 MB to 6 MB, the range does not align with the part size and the upload will fail.  
         
        This operation is idempotent. If you upload the same part multiple times, the data included in the most recent request overwrites the previously uploaded data.
