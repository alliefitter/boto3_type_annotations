You use the following process to download the job output:

              The job data, either archive data or inventory data.
        
            - **checksum** *(string) --* 
        
              The checksum of the data in the response. This header is returned only when retrieving the output for an archive retrieval job. Furthermore, this header appears only under the following conditions:
        
              * You get the entire range of the archive. 
               
              * You request a range to return of the archive that starts and ends on a multiple of 1 MB. For example, if you have an 3.1 MB archive and you specify a range to return that starts at 1 MB and ends at 2 MB, then the x-amz-sha256-tree-hash is returned as a response header. 
               
              * You request a range of the archive to return that starts on a multiple of 1 MB and goes to the end of the archive. For example, if you have a 3.1 MB archive and you specify a range that starts at 2 MB and ends at 3.1 MB (the end of the archive), then the x-amz-sha256-tree-hash is returned as a response header. 
               
            - **status** *(integer) --* 
        
              The HTTP response code for a job output request. The value depends on whether a range was specified in the request.
        
            - **contentRange** *(string) --* 
        
              The range of bytes returned by Amazon Glacier. If only partial output is downloaded, the response provides the range of bytes Amazon Glacier returned. For example, bytes 0-1048575/8388608 returns the first 1 MB from 8 MB.
        
            - **acceptRanges** *(string) --* 
        
              Indicates the range units accepted. For more information, see `RFC2616 <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html>`__ . 
        
            - **contentType** *(string) --* 
        
              The Content-Type depends on whether the job output is an archive or a vault inventory. For archive data, the Content-Type is application/octet-stream. For vault inventory, if you requested CSV format when you initiated the job, the Content-Type is text/csv. Otherwise, by default, vault inventory is returned as JSON, and the Content-Type is application/json.
        
            - **archiveDescription** *(string) --* 
        
              The description of an archive.

        In the request, you must include the computed SHA256 tree hash of the entire archive you have uploaded. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see `Computing Checksums <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html>`__ . On the server side, Amazon Glacier also constructs the SHA256 tree hash of the assembled archive. If the values match, Amazon Glacier saves the archive to the vault; otherwise, it returns an error, and the operation fails. The  ListParts operation returns a list of parts uploaded for a specific multipart upload. It includes checksum information for each uploaded part that can be used to debug a bad checksum issue.
        
        Additionally, Amazon Glacier also checks for any missing content ranges when assembling the archive, if missing content ranges are found, Amazon Glacier returns an error and the operation fails.
        
        Complete Multipart Upload is an idempotent operation. After your first successful complete multipart upload, if you call the operation again within a short period, the operation will succeed and return the same archive ID. This is useful in the event you experience a network issue that causes an aborted connection or receive a 500 server error, in which case you can repeat your Complete Multipart Upload request and get the same archive ID without creating duplicate archives. Note, however, that after the multipart upload completes, you cannot call the List Parts operation and the multipart upload will not appear in List Multipart Uploads response, even if idempotent complete is possible.

        Amazon Glacier rejects your upload part request if any of the following conditions is true:
        
        * **SHA256 tree hash does not match** To ensure that part data is not corrupted in transmission, you compute a SHA256 tree hash of the part and include it in your request. Upon receiving the part data, Amazon Glacier also computes a SHA256 tree hash. If these hash values don\'t match, the operation fails. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see `Computing Checksums <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html>`__ . 
         
        * **Part size does not match** The size of each part except the last must match the size specified in the corresponding  InitiateMultipartUpload request. The size of the last part must be the same size as, or smaller than, the specified size. 
        
        .. note::
        
           If you upload a part whose size is smaller than the part size you specified in your initiate multipart upload request and that part is not the last part, then the upload part request will succeed. However, the subsequent Complete Multipart Upload request will fail. 
        
        * **Range does not align** The byte range value in the request does not align with the part size specified in the corresponding initiate request. For example, if you specify a part size of 4194304 bytes (4 MB), then 0 to 4194303 bytes (4 MB - 1) and 4194304 (4 MB) to 8388607 (8 MB - 1) are valid part ranges. However, if you set a range value of 2 MB to 6 MB, the range does not align with the part size and the upload will fail.  
         
        This operation is idempotent. If you upload the same part multiple times, the data included in the most recent request overwrites the previously uploaded data.

        When you initiate a multipart upload, you specify the part size in number of bytes. The part size must be a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied by a power of 2-for example, 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB), 4194304 (4 MB), 8388608 (8 MB), and so on. The minimum allowable part size is 1 MB, and the maximum is 4 GB.
        
        Every part you upload to this resource (see  UploadMultipartPart ), except the last one, must have the same size. The last one can be the same size or smaller. For example, suppose you want to upload a 16.2 MB file. If you initiate the multipart upload with a part size of 4 MB, you will upload four parts of 4 MB each and one part of 0.2 MB. 
        
        .. note::
        
          You don\'t need to know the size of the archive when you start a multipart upload because Amazon Glacier does not require you to specify the overall archive size.
        
        After you complete the multipart upload, Amazon Glacier removes the multipart upload resource referenced by the ID. Amazon Glacier also removes the multipart upload resource if you cancel the multipart upload or it may be removed if there is no activity for a period of 24 hours.

        You must use the archive ID to access your data in Amazon Glacier. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned so that you can retrieve or delete the archive later. Besides saving the archive ID, you can also index it and give it a friendly name to allow for better searching. You can also use the optional archive description field to specify how the archive is referred to in an external index of archives, such as you might create in Amazon DynamoDB. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see  InitiateJob . 
        
        You must provide a SHA256 tree hash of the data you are uploading. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see `Computing Checksums <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html>`__ . 
        
        You can optionally specify an archive description of up to 1,024 printable ASCII characters. You can get the archive description when you either retrieve the archive or get the vault inventory. For more information, see  InitiateJob . Amazon Glacier does not interpret the description in any way. An archive description does not need to be unique. You cannot use the description to retrieve or sort the archive list. 
        
        Archives are immutable. After you upload an archive, you cannot edit the archive or its description.
