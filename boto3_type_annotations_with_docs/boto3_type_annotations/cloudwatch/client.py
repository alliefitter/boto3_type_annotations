          The metric queries to be returned. A single ``GetMetricData`` call can include as many as 100 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures. Each of these structures can specify either a metric to retrieve, or a math expression to perform on retrieved data. 
        
          - *(dict) --* 
        
            This structure indicates the metric data to return, and whether this call is just retrieving a batch set of data for one metric, or is performing a math expression on metric data. A single ``GetMetricData`` call can include up to 100 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures.
        
            - **Id** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
              A short name used to tie this structure to the results in the response. This name must be unique within a single call to ``GetMetricData`` . If you are performing math expressions on this set of data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the mathematical expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a lowercase letter.
        
            - **MetricStat** *(dict) --* 
        
              The metric to be returned, along with statistics, period, and units. Use this parameter only if this structure is performing a data retrieval and not performing a math expression on the returned data.
        
              Within one MetricDataQuery structure, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.

              - **Stat** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
                The statistic to return. It can include any CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic.
        
              - **Unit** *(string) --* 
        
                The unit to use for the returned data points.
        
            - **Expression** *(string) --* 
        
              The math expression to be performed on the returned data, if this structure is performing a math expression. For more information about metric math expressions, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .
        
              Within one MetricDataQuery structure, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.
        
            - **Label** *(string) --* 
        
              A human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is an expression, so that you know what the value represents. If the metric or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label is shown. If Label is omitted, CloudWatch generates a default.
        
            - **ReturnData** *(boolean) --* 
        
              Indicates whether to return the time stamps and raw data values of this metric. If you are performing this call just to do math expressions and do not also need the raw data returned, you can specify ``False`` . If you omit this, the default of ``True`` is used.
        
        :type StartTime: datetime
        :param StartTime: **[REQUIRED]** 
        
          The time stamp indicating the earliest data to be returned.
        
          For better performance, specify ``StartTime`` and ``EndTime`` values that align with the value of the metric\'s ``Period`` and sync up with the beginning and end of an hour. For example, if the ``Period`` of a metric is 5 minutes, specifying 12:05 or 12:30 as ``StartTime`` can get a faster response from CloudWatch then setting 12:07 or 12:29 as the ``StartTime`` .
        
        :type EndTime: datetime
        :param EndTime: **[REQUIRED]** 
        
          The time stamp indicating the latest data to be returned.
        
          For better performance, specify ``StartTime`` and ``EndTime`` values that align with the value of the metric\'s ``Period`` and sync up with the beginning and end of an hour. For example, if the ``Period`` of a metric is 5 minutes, specifying 12:05 or 12:30 as ``EndTime`` can get a faster response from CloudWatch then setting 12:07 or 12:29 as the ``EndTime`` .
        
        :type NextToken: string
        :param NextToken: 
        
          Include this value, if it was returned by the previous call, to get the next set of data points.
        
        :type ScanBy: string
        :param ScanBy: 
        
          The order in which data points should be returned. ``TimestampDescending`` returns the newest data first and paginates when the ``MaxDatapoints`` limit is reached. ``TimestampAscending`` returns the oldest data first and paginates when the ``MaxDatapoints`` limit is reached.
        
        :type MaxDatapoints: integer
        :param MaxDatapoints: 
        
          The maximum number of data points the request should return before paginating. If you omit this, the default of 100,800 is used.

                  The status of the returned data. ``Complete`` indicates that all data points in the requested time range were returned. ``PartialData`` means that an incomplete set of data points were returned. You can use the ``NextToken`` value that was returned and repeat your request to get more data points. ``NextToken`` is not returned if you are performing a math expression. ``InternalError`` indicates that an error occurred. Retry your request using ``NextToken`` , if present.
        
                - **Messages** *(list) --*

        """
        
        The maximum number of data points returned from a single call is 1,440. If you request more than 1,440 data points, CloudWatch returns an error. To reduce the number of data points, you can narrow the specified time range and make multiple requests across adjacent time ranges, or you can increase the specified period. Data points are not returned in chronological order.
        
        CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period that you specify. For example, if you request statistics with a one-hour period, CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time stamps that fall within each one-hour period. Therefore, the number of values aggregated by CloudWatch is larger than the number of data points returned.
        
        CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:
        
        * The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1. 
         
        * The Min and the Max values of the statistic set are equal. 
         
        Percentile statistics are not available for metrics when any of the metric values are negative numbers.
        
        Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:
        
        * Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a ``StorageResolution`` of 1. 
         
        * Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15 days. 
         
        * Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63 days. 
         
        * Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months). 
         
        Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour.
        
        CloudWatch started retaining 5-minute and 1-hour metric data as of July 9, 2016.

        :type StartTime: datetime
        :param StartTime: **[REQUIRED]** 
        
          The time stamp that determines the first data point to return. Start times are evaluated relative to the time that CloudWatch receives the request.
        
          The value specified is inclusive; results include data points with the specified time stamp. The time stamp must be in ISO 8601 UTC format (for example, 2016-10-03T23:00:00Z).
        
          CloudWatch rounds the specified time stamp as follows:
        
          * Start time less than 15 days ago - Round down to the nearest whole minute. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:32:00. 
           
          * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 5-minute clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:30:00. 
           
          * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 1-hour clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:00:00. 
           
          If you set ``Period`` to 5, 10, or 30, the start time of your request is rounded down to the nearest time that corresponds to even 5-, 10-, or 30-second divisions of a minute. For example, if you make a query at (HH:mm:ss) 01:05:23 for the previous 10-second period, the start time of your request is rounded down and you receive data from 01:05:10 to 01:05:20. If you make a query at 15:07:17 for the previous 5 minutes of data, using a period of 5 seconds, you receive data timestamped between 15:02:15 and 15:07:15.

        :param EndTime: **[REQUIRED]** 
        
          The time stamp that determines the last data point to return.
        
          The value specified is exclusive; results include data points up to the specified time stamp. The time stamp must be in ISO 8601 UTC format (for example, 2016-10-10T23:00:00Z).
        
        :type Period: integer
        :param Period: **[REQUIRED]** 
        
          The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` call that includes a ``StorageResolution`` of 1 second.
        
          If the ``StartTime`` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:
        
          * Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute). 
           
          * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes). 
           
          * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour). 
           
        :type Statistics: list
        :param Statistics: 
        
          The metric statistics, other than percentile. For percentile statistics, use ``ExtendedStatistics`` . When calling ``GetMetricStatistics`` , you must specify either ``Statistics`` or ``ExtendedStatistics`` , but not both.
        
          - *(string) --* 
        
        :type ExtendedStatistics: list

          The percentile statistics. Specify values between p0.0 and p100. When calling ``GetMetricStatistics`` , you must specify either ``Statistics`` or ``ExtendedStatistics`` , but not both. Percentile statistics are not available for metrics when any of the metric values are negative numbers.
        
          - *(string) --* 
        
        :type Unit: string
        :param Unit: 
        
          The unit for a given metric. Metrics may be reported in multiple units. Not supplying a unit results in all units being returned. If you specify only a unit that the metric does not report, the results of the call are null.

          The format of the resulting image. Only PNG images are supported.
        
          The default is ``png`` . If you specify ``png`` , the API returns an HTTP response with the content-type set to ``text/xml`` . The image data is in a ``MetricWidgetImage`` field. For example:
        
           ``<GetMetricWidgetImageResponse xmlns=\"http://monitoring.amazonaws.com/doc/2010-08-01/\">``

           ``</GetMetricWidgetImageResponse>``  
        
          The ``image/png`` setting is intended only for custom HTTP requests. For most use cases, and all actions using an AWS SDK, you should use ``png`` . If you specify ``image/png`` , the HTTP response has a content-type set to ``image/png`` , and the body of the response is a PNG image.

        There is no limit to the number of dashboards in your account. All dashboards in your account are global, not region-specific.
        
        A simple way to create a dashboard using ``PutDashboard`` is to copy an existing dashboard. To copy an existing dashboard using the console, you can load the dashboard and then use the View/edit source command in the Actions menu to display the JSON block for that dashboard. Another way to copy a dashboard is to use ``GetDashboard`` , and then use the data returned within ``DashboardBody`` as the template for the new dashboard when you call ``PutDashboard`` .
        
        When you create a dashboard with ``PutDashboard`` , a good practice is to add a text widget at the top of the dashboard with a message that the dashboard was created by script and should not be changed in the console. This message could also point console users to the location of the ``DashboardBody`` script or the CloudFormation template used to create the dashboard.

        When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA`` . The alarm is evaluated and its state is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the state are then executed.
        
        When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.
        
        If you are an IAM user, you must have Amazon EC2 permissions for some operations:
        
        * ``iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole`` for all alarms with EC2 actions 
         
        * ``ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus`` and ``ec2:DescribeInstances`` for all alarms on EC2 instance status metrics 
         
        * ``ec2:StopInstances`` for alarms with stop actions 
         
        * ``ec2:TerminateInstances`` for alarms with terminate actions 
         
        * ``ec2:DescribeInstanceRecoveryAttribute`` and ``ec2:RecoverInstances`` for alarms with recover actions 
         
        If you have read/write permissions for Amazon CloudWatch but not for Amazon EC2, you can still create an alarm, but the stop or terminate actions are not performed. However, if you are later granted the required permissions, the alarm actions that you created earlier are performed.
        
        If you are using an IAM role (for example, an EC2 instance profile), you cannot stop or terminate the instance using alarm actions. However, you can still see the alarm state and perform any other actions such as Amazon SNS notifications or Auto Scaling policies.
        
        If you are using temporary security credentials granted using AWS STS, you cannot stop or terminate an EC2 instance using alarm actions.
        
        The first time you create an alarm in the AWS Management Console, the CLI, or by using the PutMetricAlarm API, CloudWatch creates the necessary service-linked role for you. The service-linked role is called ``AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchEvents`` .

        :type Statistic: string
        :param Statistic: 
        
          The statistic for the metric associated with the alarm, other than percentile. For percentile statistics, use ``ExtendedStatistic`` . When you call ``PutMetricAlarm`` , you must specify either ``Statistic`` or ``ExtendedStatistic,`` but not both.
        
        :type ExtendedStatistic: string
        :param ExtendedStatistic: 
        
          The percentile statistic for the metric associated with the alarm. Specify a value between p0.0 and p100. When you call ``PutMetricAlarm`` , you must specify either ``Statistic`` or ``ExtendedStatistic,`` but not both.
        
        :type Dimensions: list

            Expands the identity of a metric.
        
            - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
              The name of the dimension.

        :type Period: integer
        :param Period: **[REQUIRED]** 
        
          The period, in seconds, over which the specified statistic is applied. Valid values are 10, 30, and any multiple of 60.
        
          Be sure to specify 10 or 30 only for metrics that are stored by a ``PutMetricData`` call with a ``StorageResolution`` of 1. If you specify a period of 10 or 30 for a metric that does not have sub-minute resolution, the alarm still attempts to gather data at the period rate that you specify. In this case, it does not receive data for the attempts that do not correspond to a one-minute data resolution, and the alarm may often lapse into INSUFFICENT_DATA status. Specifying 10 or 30 also sets this alarm as a high-resolution alarm, which has a higher charge than other alarms. For more information about pricing, see `Amazon CloudWatch Pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/>`__ .
        
          An alarm\'s total current evaluation period can be no longer than one day, so ``Period`` multiplied by ``EvaluationPeriods`` cannot be more than 86,400 seconds.
        
        :type Unit: string
        :param Unit: 
        
          The unit of measure for the statistic. For example, the units for the Amazon EC2 NetworkIn metric are Bytes because NetworkIn tracks the number of bytes that an instance receives on all network interfaces. You can also specify a unit when you create a custom metric. Units help provide conceptual meaning to your data. Metric data points that specify a unit of measure, such as Percent, are aggregated separately.
        
          If you specify a unit, you must use a unit that is appropriate for the metric. Otherwise, the CloudWatch alarm can get stuck in the ``INSUFFICIENT DATA`` state. 
        
        :type EvaluationPeriods: integer
        :param EvaluationPeriods: **[REQUIRED]** 
        
          The number of periods over which data is compared to the specified threshold. If you are setting an alarm which requires that a number of consecutive data points be breaching to trigger the alarm, this value specifies that number. If you are setting an \"M out of N\" alarm, this value is the N.
        
          An alarm\'s total current evaluation period can be no longer than one day, so this number multiplied by ``Period`` cannot be more than 86,400 seconds.
        
        :type DatapointsToAlarm: integer
        :param DatapointsToAlarm: 
        
          The number of datapoints that must be breaching to trigger the alarm. This is used only if you are setting an \"M out of N\" alarm. In that case, this value is the M. For more information, see `Evaluating an Alarm <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarm-evaluation>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .
        
        :type Threshold: float
        :param Threshold: **[REQUIRED]** 
        
          The value against which the specified statistic is compared.
        
        :type ComparisonOperator: string
        :param ComparisonOperator: **[REQUIRED]** 
        
          The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified statistic and threshold. The specified statistic value is used as the first operand.
        
        :type TreatMissingData: string
        :param TreatMissingData: 
        
          Sets how this alarm is to handle missing data points. If ``TreatMissingData`` is omitted, the default behavior of ``missing`` is used. For more information, see `Configuring How CloudWatch Alarms Treats Missing Data <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarms-and-missing-data>`__ .

        :param EvaluateLowSampleCountPercentile: 
        
          Used only for alarms based on percentiles. If you specify ``ignore`` , the alarm state does not change during periods with too few data points to be statistically significant. If you specify ``evaluate`` or omit this parameter, the alarm is always evaluated and possibly changes state no matter how many data points are available. For more information, see `Percentile-Based CloudWatch Alarms and Low Data Samples <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#percentiles-with-low-samples>`__ .

        You can publish either individual data points in the ``Value`` field, or arrays of values and the number of times each value occurred during the period by using the ``Values`` and ``Counts`` fields in the ``MetricDatum`` structure. Using the ``Values`` and ``Counts`` method enables you to publish up to 150 values per metric with one ``PutMetricData`` request, and supports retrieving percentile statistics on this data.
        
        Each ``PutMetricData`` request is limited to 40 KB in size for HTTP POST requests. You can send a payload compressed by gzip. Each request is also limited to no more than 20 different metrics.
        
        Although the ``Value`` parameter accepts numbers of type ``Double`` , CloudWatch rejects values that are either too small or too large. Values must be in the range of 8.515920e-109 to 1.174271e+108 (Base 10) or 2e-360 to 2e360 (Base 2). In addition, special values (for example, NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity) are not supported.
        
        You can use up to 10 dimensions per metric to further clarify what data the metric collects. For more information about specifying dimensions, see `Publishing Metrics <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .
        
        Data points with time stamps from 24 hours ago or longer can take at least 48 hours to become available for  GetMetricData or  GetMetricStatistics from the time they are submitted.
        
        CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. These raw data points could be published individually or as part of ``Values`` and ``Counts`` arrays. If you publish data using statistic sets in the ``StatisticValues`` field instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:
        
        * The ``SampleCount`` value of the statistic set is 1 and ``Min`` , ``Max`` , and ``Sum`` are all equal. 
         
        * The ``Min`` and ``Max`` are equal, and ``Sum`` is equal to ``Min`` multiplied by ``SampleCount`` .

        :type MetricData: list
        :param MetricData: **[REQUIRED]** 
        
          The data for the metric. The array can include no more than 20 metrics per call.
        
          - *(dict) --* 
        
            Encapsulates the information sent to either create a metric or add new values to be aggregated into an existing metric.
        
            - **MetricName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
              The name of the metric.
        
            - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 
        
              The dimensions associated with the metric.
        
              - *(dict) --* 
        
                Expands the identity of a metric.
        
                - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
                  The name of the dimension.
        
                - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
                  The value representing the dimension measurement.
        
            - **Timestamp** *(datetime) --* 
        
              The time the metric data was received, expressed as the number of milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.
        
            - **Value** *(float) --* 
        
              The value for the metric.
        
              Although the parameter accepts numbers of type Double, CloudWatch rejects values that are either too small or too large. Values must be in the range of 8.515920e-109 to 1.174271e+108 (Base 10) or 2e-360 to 2e360 (Base 2). In addition, special values (for example, NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity) are not supported.
        
            - **StatisticValues** *(dict) --* 
        
              The statistical values for the metric.
        
              - **SampleCount** *(float) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
                The number of samples used for the statistic set.
        
              - **Sum** *(float) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
                The sum of values for the sample set.
        
              - **Minimum** *(float) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
                The minimum value of the sample set.
        
              - **Maximum** *(float) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
                The maximum value of the sample set.
        
            - **Values** *(list) --* 
        
              Array of numbers representing the values for the metric during the period. Each unique value is listed just once in this array, and the corresponding number in the ``Counts`` array specifies the number of times that value occurred during the period. You can include up to 150 unique values in each ``PutMetricData`` action that specifies a ``Values`` array.
        
              Although the ``Values`` array accepts numbers of type ``Double`` , CloudWatch rejects values that are either too small or too large. Values must be in the range of 8.515920e-109 to 1.174271e+108 (Base 10) or 2e-360 to 2e360 (Base 2). In addition, special values (for example, NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity) are not supported.
        
              - *(float) --* 
        
            - **Counts** *(list) --* 
        
              Array of numbers that is used along with the ``Values`` array. Each number in the ``Count`` array is the number of times the corresponding value in the ``Values`` array occurred during the period. 
        
              If you omit the ``Counts`` array, the default of 1 is used as the value for each count. If you include a ``Counts`` array, it must include the same amount of values as the ``Values`` array.
        
              - *(float) --* 
        
            - **Unit** *(string) --* 
        
              The unit of the metric.
        
            - **StorageResolution** *(integer) --* 
        
              Valid values are 1 and 60. Setting this to 1 specifies this metric as a high-resolution metric, so that CloudWatch stores the metric with sub-minute resolution down to one second. Setting this to 60 specifies this metric as a regular-resolution metric, which CloudWatch stores at 1-minute resolution. Currently, high resolution is available only for custom metrics. For more information about high-resolution metrics, see `High-Resolution Metrics <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html#high-resolution-metrics>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* . 
        
              This field is optional, if you do not specify it the default of 60 is used.
