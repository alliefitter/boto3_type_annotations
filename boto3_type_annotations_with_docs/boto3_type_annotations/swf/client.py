        * Use a ``Resource`` element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains. 
         
        * Use an ``Action`` element to allow or deny permission to call this action. 
         
        * Constrain the following parameters by using a ``Condition`` element with the appropriate keys. 
        
          * ``tagFilter.tag`` : String constraint. The key is ``swf:tagFilter.tag`` . 
           
          * ``typeFilter.name`` : String constraint. The key is ``swf:typeFilter.name`` . 
           
          * ``typeFilter.version`` : String constraint. The key is ``swf:typeFilter.version`` . 
           
        If the caller doesn\'t have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute\'s ``cause`` parameter is set to ``OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`` .

              The configuration settings registered with the activity type.
        
              - **defaultTaskStartToCloseTimeout** *(string) --* 
        
                The default maximum duration for tasks of an activity type specified when registering the activity type. You can override this default when scheduling a task through the ``ScheduleActivityTask``   Decision .
        
                The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or equal to ``0`` . You can use ``NONE`` to specify unlimited duration.
        
              - **defaultTaskHeartbeatTimeout** *(string) --* 
        
                The default maximum time, in seconds, before which a worker processing a task must report progress by calling  RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat .
        
                You can specify this value only when *registering* an activity type. The registered default value can be overridden when you schedule a task through the ``ScheduleActivityTask``   Decision . If the activity worker subsequently attempts to record a heartbeat or returns a result, the activity worker receives an ``UnknownResource`` fault. In this case, Amazon SWF no longer considers the activity task to be valid; the activity worker should clean up the activity task.
        
                The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or equal to ``0`` . You can use ``NONE`` to specify unlimited duration.
        
              - **defaultTaskList** *(dict) --* 
        
                The default task list specified for this activity type at registration. This default is used if a task list isn\'t provided when a task is scheduled through the ``ScheduleActivityTask``   Decision . You can override the default registered task list when scheduling a task through the ``ScheduleActivityTask``   Decision .
        
                - **name** *(string) --* 
        
                  The name of the task list.
        
              - **defaultTaskPriority** *(string) --* 
        
                The default task priority for tasks of this activity type, specified at registration. If not set, then ``0`` is used as the default priority. This default can be overridden when scheduling an activity task.
        
                Valid values are integers that range from Java\'s ``Integer.MIN_VALUE`` (-2147483648) to ``Integer.MAX_VALUE`` (2147483647). Higher numbers indicate higher priority.
        
                For more information about setting task priority, see `Setting Task Priority <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/programming-priority.html>`__ in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide* .
        
              - **defaultTaskScheduleToStartTimeout** *(string) --* 
        
                The default maximum duration, specified when registering the activity type, that a task of an activity type can wait before being assigned to a worker. You can override this default when scheduling a task through the ``ScheduleActivityTask``   Decision .
        
                The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or equal to ``0`` . You can use ``NONE`` to specify unlimited duration.
        
              - **defaultTaskScheduleToCloseTimeout** *(string) --* 
        
                The default maximum duration, specified when registering the activity type, for tasks of this activity type. You can override this default when scheduling a task through the ``ScheduleActivityTask``   Decision .
        
                The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or equal to ``0`` . You can use ``NONE`` to specify unlimited duration.

              The status of the workflow type (returned in the WorkflowTypeInfo structure) can be one of the following.
        
              * ``REGISTERED`` – The type is registered and available. Workers supporting this type should be running. 
               
              * ``DEPRECATED`` – The type was deprecated using  DeprecateWorkflowType , but is still in use. You should keep workers supporting this type running. You cannot create new workflow executions of this type. 
               
              - **workflowType** *(dict) --* 
        
                The workflow type this information is about.

              Configuration settings of the workflow type registered through  RegisterWorkflowType  
        
              - **defaultTaskStartToCloseTimeout** *(string) --* 
        
                The default maximum duration, specified when registering the workflow type, that a decision task for executions of this workflow type might take before returning completion or failure. If the task doesn\'tdo close in the specified time then the task is automatically timed out and rescheduled. If the decider eventually reports a completion or failure, it is ignored. This default can be overridden when starting a workflow execution using the  StartWorkflowExecution action or the ``StartChildWorkflowExecution``   Decision .
        
                The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or equal to ``0`` . You can use ``NONE`` to specify unlimited duration.
        
              - **defaultExecutionStartToCloseTimeout** *(string) --* 
        
                The default maximum duration, specified when registering the workflow type, for executions of this workflow type. This default can be overridden when starting a workflow execution using the  StartWorkflowExecution action or the ``StartChildWorkflowExecution``   Decision .
        
                The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or equal to ``0`` . You can use ``NONE`` to specify unlimited duration.
        
              - **defaultTaskList** *(dict) --* 
        
                The default task list, specified when registering the workflow type, for decisions tasks scheduled for workflow executions of this type. This default can be overridden when starting a workflow execution using the  StartWorkflowExecution action or the ``StartChildWorkflowExecution``   Decision .
        
                - **name** *(string) --* 
        
                  The name of the task list.
        
              - **defaultTaskPriority** *(string) --* 
        
                The default task priority, specified when registering the workflow type, for all decision tasks of this workflow type. This default can be overridden when starting a workflow execution using the  StartWorkflowExecution action or the ``StartChildWorkflowExecution`` decision.
        
                Valid values are integers that range from Java\'s ``Integer.MIN_VALUE`` (-2147483648) to ``Integer.MAX_VALUE`` (2147483647). Higher numbers indicate higher priority.
        
                For more information about setting task priority, see `Setting Task Priority <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/programming-priority.html>`__ in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide* .
        
              - **defaultChildPolicy** *(string) --* 
        
                The default policy to use for the child workflow executions when a workflow execution of this type is terminated, by calling the  TerminateWorkflowExecution action explicitly or due to an expired timeout. This default can be overridden when starting a workflow execution using the  StartWorkflowExecution action or the ``StartChildWorkflowExecution``   Decision .
        
                The supported child policies are:
        
                * ``TERMINATE`` – The child executions are terminated. 
                 
                * ``REQUEST_CANCEL`` – A request to cancel is attempted for each child execution by recording a ``WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested`` event in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event. 
                 
                * ``ABANDON`` – No action is taken. The child executions continue to run. 
                 
              - **defaultLambdaRole** *(string) --* 
        
                The default IAM role attached to this workflow type.
        
                .. note::
        
                  Executions of this workflow type need IAM roles to invoke Lambda functions. If you don\'t specify an IAM role when starting this workflow type, the default Lambda role is attached to the execution.

         **Access Control**  
        
        You can use IAM policies to control this action\'s access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:
        
        * Use a ``Resource`` element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains. 
         
        * Use an ``Action`` element to allow or deny permission to call this action. 
         
        * You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action\'s parameters. 
         
        If the caller doesn\'t have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute\'s ``cause`` parameter is set to ``OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`` .

         **Access Control**  
        
        You can use IAM policies to control this action\'s access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:
        
        * Use a ``Resource`` element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains. The element must be set to ``arn:aws:swf::AccountID:domain/*`` , where *AccountID* is the account ID, with no dashes. 
         
        * Use an ``Action`` element to allow or deny permission to call this action. 
         
        * You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action\'s parameters. 
         
        If the caller doesn\'t have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute\'s ``cause`` parameter is set to ``OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`` .

         **Access Control**  
        
        You can use IAM policies to control this action\'s access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:
        
        * Use a ``Resource`` element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains. 
         
        * Use an ``Action`` element to allow or deny permission to call this action. 
         
        * Constrain the following parameters by using a ``Condition`` element with the appropriate keys. 
        
          * ``tagFilter.tag`` : String constraint. The key is ``swf:tagFilter.tag`` . 
           
          * ``typeFilter.name`` : String constraint. The key is ``swf:typeFilter.name`` . 
           
          * ``typeFilter.version`` : String constraint. The key is ``swf:typeFilter.version`` . 
           
        If the caller doesn\'t have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute\'s ``cause`` parameter is set to ``OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`` .

        * Use an ``Action`` element to allow or deny permission to call this action. 
         
        * Constrain the ``taskList.name`` parameter by using a ``Condition`` element with the ``swf:taskList.name`` key to allow the action to access only certain task lists. 
         
        If the caller doesn\'t have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute\'s ``cause`` parameter is set to ``OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`` .

        You can use IAM policies to control this action\'s access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:
        
        * Use a ``Resource`` element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains. 
         
        * Use an ``Action`` element to allow or deny permission to call this action. 
         
        * You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action\'s parameters. 
         
        If the caller doesn\'t have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails.

         **Access Control**  
        
        If an IAM policy grants permission to use ``RespondDecisionTaskCompleted`` , it can express permissions for the list of decisions in the ``decisions`` parameter. Each of the decisions has one or more parameters, much like a regular API call. To allow for policies to be as readable as possible, you can express permissions on decisions as if they were actual API calls, including applying conditions to some parameters.

            Specifies a decision made by the decider. A decision can be one of these types:
        
            * ``CancelTimer`` – Cancels a previously started timer and records a ``TimerCanceled`` event in the history. 
             
            * ``CancelWorkflowExecution`` – Closes the workflow execution and records a ``WorkflowExecutionCanceled`` event in the history. 
             
            * ``CompleteWorkflowExecution`` – Closes the workflow execution and records a ``WorkflowExecutionCompleted`` event in the history . 
             
            * ``ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution`` – Closes the workflow execution and starts a new workflow execution of the same type using the same workflow ID and a unique run Id. A ``WorkflowExecutionContinuedAsNew`` event is recorded in the history. 
             
            * ``FailWorkflowExecution`` – Closes the workflow execution and records a ``WorkflowExecutionFailed`` event in the history. 
             
            * ``RecordMarker`` – Records a ``MarkerRecorded`` event in the history. Markers can be used for adding custom information in the history for instance to let deciders know that they don\'t need to look at the history beyond the marker event. 
             
            * ``RequestCancelActivityTask`` – Attempts to cancel a previously scheduled activity task. If the activity task was scheduled but has not been assigned to a worker, then it is canceled. If the activity task was already assigned to a worker, then the worker is informed that cancellation has been requested in the response to  RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat . 
             
            * ``RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution`` – Requests that a request be made to cancel the specified external workflow execution and records a ``RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated`` event in the history. 
             
            * ``ScheduleActivityTask`` – Schedules an activity task. 
             
            * ``SignalExternalWorkflowExecution`` – Requests a signal to be delivered to the specified external workflow execution and records a ``SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated`` event in the history. 
             
            * ``StartChildWorkflowExecution`` – Requests that a child workflow execution be started and records a ``StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated`` event in the history. The child workflow execution is a separate workflow execution with its own history. 
             
            * ``StartTimer`` – Starts a timer for this workflow execution and records a ``TimerStarted`` event in the history. This timer fires after the specified delay and record a ``TimerFired`` event. 
             
             **Access Control**  
        
            If you grant permission to use ``RespondDecisionTaskCompleted`` , you can use IAM policies to express permissions for the list of decisions returned by this action as if they were members of the API. Treating decisions as a pseudo API maintains a uniform conceptual model and helps keep policies readable. For details and example IAM policies, see `Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html>`__ in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide* .
        
             **Decision Failure**  
        
            Decisions can fail for several reasons
        
            * The ordering of decisions should follow a logical flow. Some decisions might not make sense in the current context of the workflow execution and therefore fails. 
             
            * A limit on your account was reached. 
             
            * The decision lacks sufficient permissions. 
             
            One of the following events might be added to the history to indicate an error. The event attribute\'s ``cause`` parameter indicates the cause. If ``cause`` is set to ``OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`` , the decision failed because it lacked sufficient permissions. For details and example IAM policies, see `Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html>`__ in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide* .
        
            * ``ScheduleActivityTaskFailed`` – A ``ScheduleActivityTask`` decision failed. This could happen if the activity type specified in the decision isn\'t registered, is in a deprecated state, or the decision isn\'t properly configured. 
             
            * ``RequestCancelActivityTaskFailed`` – A ``RequestCancelActivityTask`` decision failed. This could happen if there is no open activity task with the specified activityId. 
             
            * ``StartTimerFailed`` – A ``StartTimer`` decision failed. This could happen if there is another open timer with the same timerId. 
             
            * ``CancelTimerFailed`` – A ``CancelTimer`` decision failed. This could happen if there is no open timer with the specified timerId. 
             
            * ``StartChildWorkflowExecutionFailed`` – A ``StartChildWorkflowExecution`` decision failed. This could happen if the workflow type specified isn\'t registered, is deprecated, or the decision isn\'t properly configured. 
             
            * ``SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed`` – A ``SignalExternalWorkflowExecution`` decision failed. This could happen if the ``workflowID`` specified in the decision was incorrect. 
             
            * ``RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed`` – A ``RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution`` decision failed. This could happen if the ``workflowID`` specified in the decision was incorrect. 
             
            * ``CancelWorkflowExecutionFailed`` – A ``CancelWorkflowExecution`` decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution. 
             
            * ``CompleteWorkflowExecutionFailed`` – A ``CompleteWorkflowExecution`` decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution. 
             
            * ``ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionFailed`` – A ``ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution`` decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution or the ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution decision was not configured correctly. 
             
            * ``FailWorkflowExecutionFailed`` – A ``FailWorkflowExecution`` decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution. 
             
            The preceding error events might occur due to an error in the decider logic, which might put the workflow execution in an unstable state The cause field in the event structure for the error event indicates the cause of the error.
        
            .. note::
        
              A workflow execution may be closed by the decider by returning one of the following decisions when completing a decision task: ``CompleteWorkflowExecution`` , ``FailWorkflowExecution`` , ``CancelWorkflowExecution`` and ``ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution`` . An ``UnhandledDecision`` fault is returned if a workflow closing decision is specified and a signal or activity event had been added to the history while the decision task was being performed by the decider. Unlike the above situations which are logic issues, this fault is always possible because of race conditions in a distributed system. The right action here is to call  RespondDecisionTaskCompleted without any decisions. This would result in another decision task with these new events included in the history. The decider should handle the new events and may decide to close the workflow execution.
        
             **How to Code a Decision**  
        
            You code a decision by first setting the decision type field to one of the above decision values, and then set the corresponding attributes field shown below:

        :type domain: string
        :param domain: **[REQUIRED]** 
        
          The domain of the workflow execution to terminate.
        
        :type workflowId: string
        :param workflowId: **[REQUIRED]** 
        
          The workflowId of the workflow execution to terminate.
        
        :type runId: string
        :param runId: 
        
          The runId of the workflow execution to terminate.
        
        :type reason: string
        :param reason: 
        
          A descriptive reason for terminating the workflow execution.
        
        :type details: string
        :param details: 
        
          Details for terminating the workflow execution.
        
        :type childPolicy: string
        :param childPolicy: 
        
          If set, specifies the policy to use for the child workflow executions of the workflow execution being terminated. This policy overrides the child policy specified for the workflow execution at registration time or when starting the execution.
        
          The supported child policies are:
        
          * ``TERMINATE`` – The child executions are terminated. 
           
          * ``REQUEST_CANCEL`` – A request to cancel is attempted for each child execution by recording a ``WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested`` event in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event. 
           
          * ``ABANDON`` – No action is taken. The child executions continue to run. 
           
          .. note::
        
            A child policy for this workflow execution must be specified either as a default for the workflow type or through this parameter. If neither this parameter is set nor a default child policy was specified at registration time then a fault is returned.
