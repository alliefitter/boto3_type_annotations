        * If you don\'t specify the ``FifoQueue`` attribute, Amazon SQS creates a standard queue. 
        
        .. note::
        
           You can\'t change the queue type after you create it and you can\'t convert an existing standard queue into a FIFO queue. You must either create a new FIFO queue for your application or delete your existing standard queue and recreate it as a FIFO queue. For more information, see `Moving From a Standard Queue to a FIFO Queue <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html#FIFO-queues-moving>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide* .  
        
        * If you don\'t provide a value for an attribute, the queue is created with the default value for the attribute. 
         
        * If you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before creating a queue with the same name. 
         
        To successfully create a new queue, you must provide a queue name that adheres to the `limits related to queues <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/limits-queues.html>`__ and is unique within the scope of your queues.
        
        To get the queue URL, use the ``  GetQueueUrl `` action. ``  GetQueueUrl `` requires only the ``QueueName`` parameter. be aware of existing queue names:
        
        * If you provide the name of an existing queue along with the exact names and values of all the queue\'s attributes, ``CreateQueue`` returns the queue URL for the existing queue. 
         
        * If the queue name, attribute names, or attribute values don\'t match an existing queue, ``CreateQueue`` returns an error. 
         
        Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the ``param.n`` notation. Values of ``n`` are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:

          The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special request parameters that the ``CreateQueue`` action uses:
        
          * ``DelaySeconds`` - The length of time, in seconds, for which the delivery of all messages in the queue is delayed. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 900 seconds (15 minutes). Default: 0.  
           
          * ``MaximumMessageSize`` - The limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer from 1,024 bytes (1 KiB) to 262,144 bytes (256 KiB). Default: 262,144 (256 KiB).  
           
          * ``MessageRetentionPeriod`` - The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values: An integer from 60 seconds (1 minute) to 1,209,600 seconds (14 days). Default: 345,600 (4 days).  
           
          * ``Policy`` - The queue\'s policy. A valid AWS policy. For more information about policy structure, see `Overview of AWS IAM Policies <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/PoliciesOverview.html>`__ in the *Amazon IAM User Guide* .  
           
          * ``ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds`` - The length of time, in seconds, for which a ``  ReceiveMessage `` action waits for a message to arrive. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). Default: 0.  
           
          * ``RedrivePolicy`` - The string that includes the parameters for the dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue. For more information about the redrive policy and dead-letter queues, see `Using Amazon SQS Dead-Letter Queues <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide* .  
        
            * ``deadLetterTargetArn`` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the value of ``maxReceiveCount`` is exceeded. 
             
            * ``maxReceiveCount`` - The number of times a message is delivered to the source queue before being moved to the dead-letter queue. When the ``ReceiveCount`` for a message exceeds the ``maxReceiveCount`` for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the dead-letter-queue. 
             
          .. note::
        
            The dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue. Similarly, the dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also be a standard queue.
        
          * ``VisibilityTimeout`` - The visibility timeout for the queue, in seconds. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours). Default: 30. For more information about the visibility timeout, see `Visibility Timeout <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide* . 
           
          The following attributes apply only to `server-side-encryption <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html>`__ :
        
          * ``KmsMasterKeyId`` - The ID of an AWS-managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see `Key Terms <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-sse-key-terms>`__ . While the alias of the AWS-managed CMK for Amazon SQS is always ``alias/aws/sqs`` , the alias of a custom CMK can, for example, be ``alias/*MyAlias* `` . For more examples, see `KeyId <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html#API_DescribeKey_RequestParameters>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service API Reference* .  
           
          * ``KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds`` - The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a `data key <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#data-keys>`__ to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling AWS KMS again. An integer representing seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24 hours). Default: 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time period provides better security but results in more calls to KMS which might incur charges after Free Tier. For more information, see `How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work? <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-how-does-the-data-key-reuse-period-work>`__ .  
           
          The following attributes apply only to `FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html>`__ :
        
          * ``FifoQueue`` - Designates a queue as FIFO. Valid values: ``true`` , ``false`` . You can provide this attribute only during queue creation. You can\'t change it for an existing queue. When you set this attribute, you must also provide the ``MessageGroupId`` for your messages explicitly. For more information, see `FIFO Queue Logic <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html#FIFO-queues-understanding-logic>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide* . 
           
          * ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` - Enables content-based deduplication. Valid values: ``true`` , ``false`` . For more information, see `Exactly-Once Processing <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html#FIFO-queues-exactly-once-processing>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide* .  
        
            * Every message must have a unique ``MessageDeduplicationId`` , 
        
              * You may provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` explicitly. 
               
              * If you aren\'t able to provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` and you enable ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` for your queue, Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the ``MessageDeduplicationId`` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).  
               
              * If you don\'t provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` and the queue doesn\'t have ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` set, the action fails with an error. 
               
              * If the queue has ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` set, your ``MessageDeduplicationId`` overrides the generated one. 
               
            * When ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered. 
             
            * If you send one message with ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` enabled and then another message with a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` that is the same as the one generated for the first ``MessageDeduplicationId`` , the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.

You can continue to call ``ChangeMessageVisibility`` to extend the visibility timeout to a maximum of 12 hours. If you try to extend the visibility timeout beyond 12 hours, your request is rejected.
        
        A message is considered to be *in flight* after it\'s received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue.
        
        For standard queues, there can be a maximum of 120,000 inflight messages per queue. If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns the ``OverLimit`` error message. To avoid reaching the limit, you should delete messages from the queue after they\'re processed. You can also increase the number of queues you use to process your messages.
        
        For FIFO queues, there can be a maximum of 20,000 inflight messages per queue. If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns no error messages.

          If you attempt to set the ``VisibilityTimeout`` to a value greater than the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. Amazon SQS doesn\'t automatically recalculate and increase the timeout to the maximum remaining time.
        
          Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a specific message the timeout value is applied immediately but isn\'t saved in memory for that message. If you don\'t delete a message after it is received, the visibility timeout for the message reverts to the original timeout value (not to the value you set using the ``ChangeMessageVisibility`` action) the next time the message is received.

When you use the ``DeleteMessage`` action, you must provide the most recently received ``ReceiptHandle`` for the message (otherwise, the request succeeds, but the message might not be deleted).
        
          For standard queues, it is possible to receive a message even after you delete it. This might happen on rare occasions if one of the servers which stores a copy of the message is unavailable when you send the request to delete the message. The copy remains on the server and might be returned to you during a subsequent receive request. You should ensure that your application is idempotent, so that receiving a message more than once does not cause issues.

        Short poll is the default behavior where a weighted random set of machines is sampled on a ``ReceiveMessage`` call. Thus, only the messages on the sampled machines are returned. If the number of messages in the queue is small (fewer than 1,000), you most likely get fewer messages than you requested per ``ReceiveMessage`` call. If the number of messages in the queue is extremely small, you might not receive any messages in a particular ``ReceiveMessage`` response. If this happens, repeat the request. 
        
        For each message returned, the response includes the following:
        
        * The message body. 
         
        * An MD5 digest of the message body. For information about MD5, see `RFC1321 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt>`__ .

        * The message attributes. 
         
        * An MD5 digest of the message attributes. 
         
        The receipt handle is the identifier you must provide when deleting the message. For more information, see `Queue and Message Identifiers <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-queue-message-identifiers.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide* .
        
        You can provide the ``VisibilityTimeout`` parameter in your request. The parameter is applied to the messages that Amazon SQS returns in the response. If you don\'t include the parameter, the overall visibility timeout for the queue is used for the returned messages. For more information, see `Visibility Timeout <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide* .
        
        A message that isn\'t deleted or a message whose visibility isn\'t extended before the visibility timeout expires counts as a failed receive. Depending on the configuration of the queue, the message might be sent to the dead-letter queue.
        
        .. note::
        
          In the future, new attributes might be added. If you write code that calls this action, we recommend that you structure your code so that it can handle new attributes gracefully.

          The duration (in seconds) for which the call waits for a message to arrive in the queue before returning. If a message is available, the call returns sooner than ``WaitTimeSeconds`` . If no messages are available and the wait time expires, the call returns successfully with an empty list of messages.

        :param ReceiveRequestAttemptId: 
        
          This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.
        
          The token used for deduplication of ``ReceiveMessage`` calls. If a networking issue occurs after a ``ReceiveMessage`` action, and instead of a response you receive a generic error, you can retry the same action with an identical ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` to retrieve the same set of messages, even if their visibility timeout has not yet expired.
        
          * You can use ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` only for 5 minutes after a ``ReceiveMessage`` action. 
           
          * When you set ``FifoQueue`` , a caller of the ``ReceiveMessage`` action can provide a ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` explicitly. 
           
          * If a caller of the ``ReceiveMessage`` action doesn\'t provide a ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` , Amazon SQS generates a ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` . 
           
          * You can retry the ``ReceiveMessage`` action with the same ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` if none of the messages have been modified (deleted or had their visibility changes). 
           
          * During a visibility timeout, subsequent calls with the same ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` return the same messages and receipt handles. If a retry occurs within the deduplication interval, it resets the visibility timeout. For more information, see `Visibility Timeout <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide* . 
        
          .. warning::
        
             If a caller of the ``ReceiveMessage`` action still processes messages when the visibility timeout expires and messages become visible, another worker consuming from the same queue can receive the same messages and therefore process duplicates. Also, if a consumer whose message processing time is longer than the visibility timeout tries to delete the processed messages, the action fails with an error. To mitigate this effect, ensure that your application observes a safe threshold before the visibility timeout expires and extend the visibility timeout as necessary. 
        
          * While messages with a particular ``MessageGroupId`` are invisible, no more messages belonging to the same ``MessageGroupId`` are returned until the visibility timeout expires. You can still receive messages with another ``MessageGroupId`` as long as it is also visible. 
           
          * If a caller of ``ReceiveMessage`` can\'t track the ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` , no retries work until the original visibility timeout expires. As a result, delays might occur but the messages in the queue remain in a strict order. 
           
          The length of ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` is 128 characters. ``ReceiveRequestAttemptId`` can contain alphanumeric characters (``a-z`` , ``A-Z`` , ``0-9`` ) and punctuation (``!\"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~`` ).

          * When ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered. 
           
          * If you send one message with ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` enabled and then another message with a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` that is the same as the one generated for the first ``MessageDeduplicationId`` , the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.  
           
          .. note::
        
            The ``MessageDeduplicationId`` is available to the consumer of the message (this can be useful for troubleshooting delivery issues).
        
            If a message is sent successfully but the acknowledgement is lost and the message is resent with the same ``MessageDeduplicationId`` after the deduplication interval, Amazon SQS can\'t detect duplicate messages.
        
            Amazon SQS continues to keep track of the message deduplication ID even after the message is received and deleted.

        :param MessageGroupId: 
        
          This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.
        
          The tag that specifies that a message belongs to a specific message group. Messages that belong to the same message group are processed in a FIFO manner (however, messages in different message groups might be processed out of order). To interleave multiple ordered streams within a single queue, use ``MessageGroupId`` values (for example, session data for multiple users). In this scenario, multiple consumers can process the queue, but the session data of each user is processed in a FIFO fashion.
        
          * You must associate a non-empty ``MessageGroupId`` with a message. If you don\'t provide a ``MessageGroupId`` , the action fails.

              An identifier for a message in this batch used to communicate the result.
        
              .. note::
        
                The ``Id`` s of a batch request need to be unique within a request
        
                This identifier can have up to 80 characters. The following characters are accepted: alphanumeric characters, hyphens(-), and underscores (_).
        
            - **MessageBody** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
              The body of the message.
        
            - **DelaySeconds** *(integer) --* 
        
              The length of time, in seconds, for which a specific message is delayed. Valid values: 0 to 900. Maximum: 15 minutes. Messages with a positive ``DelaySeconds`` value become available for processing after the delay period is finished. If you don\'t specify a value, the default value for the queue is applied. 
        
              .. note::
        
                When you set ``FifoQueue`` , you can\'t set ``DelaySeconds`` per message. You can set this parameter only on a queue level.
        
            - **MessageAttributes** *(dict) --* 
        
              Each message attribute consists of a ``Name`` , ``Type`` , and ``Value`` . For more information, see `Amazon SQS Message Attributes <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-message-attributes.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide* .
        
              - *(string) --* 
        
                - *(dict) --* 
        
                  The user-specified message attribute value. For string data types, the ``Value`` attribute has the same restrictions on the content as the message body. For more information, see ``  SendMessage .``  
        
                   ``Name`` , ``type`` , ``value`` and the message body must not be empty or null. All parts of the message attribute, including ``Name`` , ``Type`` , and ``Value`` , are part of the message size restriction (256 KB or 262,144 bytes).
        
                  - **StringValue** *(string) --* 
        
                    Strings are Unicode with UTF-8 binary encoding. For a list of code values, see `ASCII Printable Characters <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters>`__ .
        
                  - **BinaryValue** *(bytes) --* 
        
                    Binary type attributes can store any binary data, such as compressed data, encrypted data, or images.
        
                  - **StringListValues** *(list) --* 
        
                    Not implemented. Reserved for future use.
        
                    - *(string) --*

                    - *(bytes) --* 
        
                  - **DataType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
                    Amazon SQS supports the following logical data types: ``String`` , ``Number`` , and ``Binary`` . For the ``Number`` data type, you must use ``StringValue`` .
        
                    You can also append custom labels. For more information, see `Amazon SQS Message Attributes <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-message-attributes.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide* .
        
            - **MessageDeduplicationId** *(string) --* 
        
              This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.
        
              The token used for deduplication of messages within a 5-minute minimum deduplication interval. If a message with a particular ``MessageDeduplicationId`` is sent successfully, subsequent messages with the same ``MessageDeduplicationId`` are accepted successfully but aren\'t delivered. For more information, see `Exactly-Once Processing <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html#FIFO-queues-exactly-once-processing>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide* .
        
              * Every message must have a unique ``MessageDeduplicationId`` , 
        
                * You may provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` explicitly. 
                 
                * If you aren\'t able to provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` and you enable ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` for your queue, Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the ``MessageDeduplicationId`` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).  
                 
                * If you don\'t provide a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` and the queue doesn\'t have ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` set, the action fails with an error. 
                 
                * If the queue has ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` set, your ``MessageDeduplicationId`` overrides the generated one. 
                 
              * When ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered. 
               
              * If you send one message with ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` enabled and then another message with a ``MessageDeduplicationId`` that is the same as the one generated for the first ``MessageDeduplicationId`` , the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.  
               
              .. note::
        
                The ``MessageDeduplicationId`` is available to the consumer of the message (this can be useful for troubleshooting delivery issues).
        
                If a message is sent successfully but the acknowledgement is lost and the message is resent with the same ``MessageDeduplicationId`` after the deduplication interval, Amazon SQS can\'t detect duplicate messages.
        
                Amazon SQS continues to keep track of the message deduplication ID even after the message is received and deleted.
        
              The length of ``MessageDeduplicationId`` is 128 characters. ``MessageDeduplicationId`` can contain alphanumeric characters (``a-z`` , ``A-Z`` , ``0-9`` ) and punctuation (``!\"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~`` ).
        
              For best practices of using ``MessageDeduplicationId`` , see `Using the MessageDeduplicationId Property <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-messagededuplicationid-property.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide* .
        
            - **MessageGroupId** *(string) --* 
        
              This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.
        
              The tag that specifies that a message belongs to a specific message group. Messages that belong to the same message group are processed in a FIFO manner (however, messages in different message groups might be processed out of order). To interleave multiple ordered streams within a single queue, use ``MessageGroupId`` values (for example, session data for multiple users). In this scenario, multiple consumers can process the queue, but the session data of each user is processed in a FIFO fashion.
        
              * You must associate a non-empty ``MessageGroupId`` with a message. If you don\'t provide a ``MessageGroupId`` , the action fails. 
               
              * ``ReceiveMessage`` might return messages with multiple ``MessageGroupId`` values. For each ``MessageGroupId`` , the messages are sorted by time sent. The caller can\'t specify a ``MessageGroupId`` . 
               
              The length of ``MessageGroupId`` is 128 characters. Valid values: alphanumeric characters and punctuation ``(!\"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~)`` .
        
              For best practices of using ``MessageGroupId`` , see `Using the MessageGroupId Property <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-messagegroupid-property.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide* .
        
              .. warning::
        
                 ``MessageGroupId`` is required for FIFO queues. You can\'t use it for Standard queues.

          A map of attributes to set.
        
          The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special request parameters that the ``SetQueueAttributes`` action uses:
        
          * ``DelaySeconds`` - The length of time, in seconds, for which the delivery of all messages in the queue is delayed. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 900 (15 minutes). Default: 0.  
           
          * ``MaximumMessageSize`` - The limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer from 1,024 bytes (1 KiB) up to 262,144 bytes (256 KiB). Default: 262,144 (256 KiB).  
           
          * ``MessageRetentionPeriod`` - The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values: An integer representing seconds, from 60 (1 minute) to 1,209,600 (14 days). Default: 345,600 (4 days).  
           
          * ``Policy`` - The queue\'s policy. A valid AWS policy. For more information about policy structure, see `Overview of AWS IAM Policies <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/PoliciesOverview.html>`__ in the *Amazon IAM User Guide* .  
           
          * ``ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds`` - The length of time, in seconds, for which a ``  ReceiveMessage `` action waits for a message to arrive. Valid values: an integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). Default: 0.  
           
          * ``RedrivePolicy`` - The string that includes the parameters for the dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue. For more information about the redrive policy and dead-letter queues, see `Using Amazon SQS Dead-Letter Queues <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide* .  
        
            * ``deadLetterTargetArn`` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the value of ``maxReceiveCount`` is exceeded. 
             
            * ``maxReceiveCount`` - The number of times a message is delivered to the source queue before being moved to the dead-letter queue. When the ``ReceiveCount`` for a message exceeds the ``maxReceiveCount`` for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the dead-letter-queue. 
             
          .. note::
        
            The dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue. Similarly, the dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also be a standard queue.
        
          * ``VisibilityTimeout`` - The visibility timeout for the queue, in seconds. Valid values: an integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours). Default: 30. For more information about the visibility timeout, see `Visibility Timeout <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide* . 
           
          The following attributes apply only to `server-side-encryption <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html>`__ :
        
          * ``KmsMasterKeyId`` - The ID of an AWS-managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see `Key Terms <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-sse-key-terms>`__ . While the alias of the AWS-managed CMK for Amazon SQS is always ``alias/aws/sqs`` , the alias of a custom CMK can, for example, be ``alias/*MyAlias* `` . For more examples, see `KeyId <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html#API_DescribeKey_RequestParameters>`__ in the *AWS Key Management Service API Reference* .  
           
          * ``KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds`` - The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a `data key <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#data-keys>`__ to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling AWS KMS again. An integer representing seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24 hours). Default: 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time period provides better security but results in more calls to KMS which might incur charges after Free Tier. For more information, see `How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work? <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-how-does-the-data-key-reuse-period-work>`__ .
