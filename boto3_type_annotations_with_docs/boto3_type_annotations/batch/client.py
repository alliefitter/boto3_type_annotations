        In a managed compute environment, AWS Batch manages the capacity and instance types of the compute resources within the environment, based on the compute resource specification that you define or `launch template <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html>`__ that you specify when you create the compute environment. You can choose to use Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances or Spot Instances in your managed compute environment. You can optionally set a maximum price so that Spot Instances only launch when the Spot Instance price is below a specified percentage of the On-Demand price.
        
        In an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your own compute resources. This provides more compute resource configuration options, such as using a custom AMI, but you must ensure that your AMI meets the Amazon ECS container instance AMI specification. For more information, see `Container Instance AMIs <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container_instance_AMIs.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* . After you have created your unmanaged compute environment, you can use the  DescribeComputeEnvironments operation to find the Amazon ECS cluster that is associated with it and then manually launch your container instances into that Amazon ECS cluster. For more information, see `Launching an Amazon ECS Container Instance <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_container_instance.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .
        
        .. note::
        
          AWS Batch does not upgrade the AMIs in a compute environment after it is created (for example, when a newer version of the Amazon ECS-optimized AMI is available). You are responsible for the management of the guest operating system (including updates and security patches) and any additional application software or utilities that you install on the compute resources. To use a new AMI for your AWS Batch jobs:
        
          * Create a new compute environment with the new AMI. 
           
          * Add the compute environment to an existing job queue. 
           
          * Remove the old compute environment from your job queue. 
           
          * Delete the old compute environment.

For example, if your maximum percentage is 20%, then the Spot price must be below 20% of the current On-Demand price for that EC2 instance. You always pay the lowest (market) price and never more than your maximum percentage. If you leave this field empty, the default value is 100% of the On-Demand price.
        
          - **spotIamFleetRole** *(string) --* 
        
            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet IAM role applied to a ``SPOT`` compute environment.

            The launch template to use for your compute resources. Any other compute resource parameters that you specify in a  CreateComputeEnvironment API operation override the same parameters in the launch template. You must specify either the launch template ID or launch template name in the request, but not both. 
        
            - **launchTemplateId** *(string) --*

        :param serviceRole: **[REQUIRED]** 
        
          The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows AWS Batch to make calls to other AWS services on your behalf.
        
          If your specified role has a path other than ``/`` , then you must either specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name with the path.
        
          .. note::
        
            Depending on how you created your AWS Batch service role, its ARN may contain the ``service-role`` path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, AWS Batch assumes that your ARN does not use the ``service-role`` path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.

          - *(dict) --* 
            
            - **computeEnvironments** *(list) --* 
        
              The list of compute environments.
        
              - *(dict) --* 
        
                An object representing an AWS Batch compute environment.
        
                - **computeEnvironmentName** *(string) --* 
        
                  The name of the compute environment. 
        
                - **computeEnvironmentArn** *(string) --* 
        
                  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environment. 
        
                - **ecsClusterArn** *(string) --* 
        
                  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the underlying Amazon ECS cluster used by the compute environment. 
        
                - **type** *(string) --* 
        
                  The type of the compute environment.
        
                - **state** *(string) --* 
        
                  The state of the compute environment. The valid values are ``ENABLED`` or ``DISABLED`` . 
        
                  If the state is ``ENABLED`` , then the AWS Batch scheduler can attempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on job queue demand.
        
                  If the state is ``DISABLED`` , then the AWS Batch scheduler does not attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a ``STARTING`` or ``RUNNING`` state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the ``DISABLED`` state do not scale out; however, they scale in to ``minvCpus`` value once instances become idle.
        
                - **status** *(string) --* 
        
                  The current status of the compute environment (for example, ``CREATING`` or ``VALID`` ).

                  The compute resources defined for the compute environment. 
        
                  - **type** *(string) --* 
        
                    The type of compute environment.
        
                  - **minvCpus** *(integer) --* 
        
                    The minimum number of EC2 vCPUs that an environment should maintain (even if the compute environment is ``DISABLED`` ). 
        
                  - **maxvCpus** *(integer) --* 
        
                    The maximum number of EC2 vCPUs that an environment can reach.

You can specify instance families to launch any instance type within those families (for example, ``c4`` or ``p3`` ), or you can specify specific sizes within a family (such as ``c4.8xlarge`` ). You can also choose ``optimal`` to pick instance types (from the latest C, M, and R instance families) on the fly that match the demand of your job queues.
        
                    - *(string) --* 
                
                  - **imageId** *(string) --* 
        
                    The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID used for instances launched in the compute environment.
        
                  - **subnets** *(list) --* 
        
                    The VPC subnets into which the compute resources are launched.

                    The EC2 key pair that is used for instances launched in the compute environment.
        
                  - **instanceRole** *(string) --* 
        
                    The Amazon ECS instance profile applied to Amazon EC2 instances in a compute environment. You can specify the short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an instance profile. For example, ``ecsInstanceRole`` or ``arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:instance-profile/ecsInstanceRole`` . For more information, see `Amazon ECS Instance Role <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/instance_IAM_role.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .
        
                  - **tags** *(dict) --* 
        
                    Key-value pair tags to be applied to resources that are launched in the compute environment.

                  - **bidPercentage** *(integer) --* 
        
                    The maximum percentage that a Spot Instance price can be when compared with the On-Demand price for that instance type before instances are launched. For example, if your maximum percentage is 20%, then the Spot price must be below 20% of the current On-Demand price for that EC2 instance. You always pay the lowest (market) price and never more than your maximum percentage. If you leave this field empty, the default value is 100% of the On-Demand price.
        
                  - **spotIamFleetRole** *(string) --* 
        
                    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet IAM role applied to a ``SPOT`` compute environment.
        
                  - **launchTemplate** *(dict) --* 
        
                    The launch template to use for your compute resources. Any other compute resource parameters that you specify in a  CreateComputeEnvironment API operation override the same parameters in the launch template. You must specify either the launch template ID or launch template name in the request, but not both. 
        
                    - **launchTemplateId** *(string) --* 
        
                      The ID of the launch template.
        
                    - **launchTemplateName** *(string) --*

                    * Images in official repositories on Docker Hub use a single name (for example, ``ubuntu`` or ``mongo`` ). 
                     
                    * Images in other repositories on Docker Hub are qualified with an organization name (for example, ``amazon/amazon-ecs-agent`` ). 
                     
                    * Images in other online repositories are qualified further by a domain name (for example, ``quay.io/assemblyline/ubuntu`` ).

                    The hard limit (in MiB) of memory to present to the container. If your container attempts to exceed the memory specified here, the container is killed. This parameter maps to ``Memory`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.23/>`__ and the ``--memory`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . You must specify at least 4 MiB of memory for a job.
        
                    .. note::
        
                      If you are trying to maximize your resource utilization by providing your jobs as much memory as possible for a particular instance type, see `Memory Management <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/memory-management.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

                        The contents of the ``host`` parameter determine whether your data volume persists on the host container instance and where it is stored. If the host parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon assigns a host path for your data volume. However, the data is not guaranteed to persist after the containers associated with it stop running.
        
                        - **sourcePath** *(string) --* 
        
                          The path on the host container instance that is presented to the container. If this parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon has assigned a host path for you. If the ``host`` parameter contains a ``sourcePath`` file location, then the data volume persists at the specified location on the host container instance until you delete it manually. If the ``sourcePath`` value does not exist on the host container instance, the Docker daemon creates it. If the location does exist, the contents of the source path folder are exported.
        
                      - **name** *(string) --* 
        
                        The name of the volume. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. This name is referenced in the ``sourceVolume`` parameter of container definition ``mountPoints`` .
        
                  - **environment** *(list) --* 
        
                    The environment variables to pass to a container. This parameter maps to ``Env`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.23/>`__ and the ``--env`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ .

                        If this value is ``true`` , the container has read-only access to the volume; otherwise, the container can write to the volume. The default value is ``false`` .
        
                      - **sourceVolume** *(string) --* 
        
                        The name of the volume to mount.
        
                  - **readonlyRootFilesystem** *(boolean) --* 
        
                    When this parameter is true, the container is given read-only access to its root file system. This parameter maps to ``ReadonlyRootfs`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.23/>`__ and the ``--read-only`` option to ``docker run`` .

          The maximum number of results returned by ``DescribeJobQueues`` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, ``DescribeJobQueues`` only returns ``maxResults`` results in a single page along with a ``nextToken`` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another ``DescribeJobQueues`` request with the returned ``nextToken`` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter is not used, then ``DescribeJobQueues`` returns up to 100 results and a ``nextToken`` value if applicable.

                        The contents of the ``host`` parameter determine whether your data volume persists on the host container instance and where it is stored. If the host parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon assigns a host path for your data volume. However, the data is not guaranteed to persist after the containers associated with it stop running.

                          The path on the host container instance that is presented to the container. If this parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon has assigned a host path for you. If the ``host`` parameter contains a ``sourcePath`` file location, then the data volume persists at the specified location on the host container instance until you delete it manually. If the ``sourcePath`` value does not exist on the host container instance, the Docker daemon creates it. If the location does exist, the contents of the source path folder are exported.

Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. You must specify at least one vCPU.
        
          - **memory** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
            The hard limit (in MiB) of memory to present to the container. If your container attempts to exceed the memory specified here, the container is killed. This parameter maps to ``Memory`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.23/>`__ and the ``--memory`` option to `docker run <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`__ . You must specify at least 4 MiB of memory for a job.
        
            .. note::
        
              If you are trying to maximize your resource utilization by providing your jobs as much memory as possible for a particular instance type, see `Memory Management <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/memory-management.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch User Guide* .

                The contents of the ``host`` parameter determine whether your data volume persists on the host container instance and where it is stored. If the host parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon assigns a host path for your data volume. However, the data is not guaranteed to persist after the containers associated with it stop running.

                  The path on the host container instance that is presented to the container. If this parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon has assigned a host path for you. If the ``host`` parameter contains a ``sourcePath`` file location, then the data volume persists at the specified location on the host container instance until you delete it manually. If the ``sourcePath`` value does not exist on the host container instance, the Docker daemon creates it. If the location does exist, the contents of the source path folder are exported.
        
              - **name** *(string) --* 
        
                The name of the volume. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. This name is referenced in the ``sourceVolume`` parameter of container definition ``mountPoints`` .

              - **readOnly** *(boolean) --* 
        
                If this value is ``true`` , the container has read-only access to the volume; otherwise, the container can write to the volume. The default value is ``false`` .
        
              - **sourceVolume** *(string) --* 
        
                The name of the volume to mount.
        
          - **readonlyRootFilesystem** *(boolean) --* 
        
            When this parameter is true, the container is given read-only access to its root file system. This parameter maps to ``ReadonlyRootfs`` in the `Create a container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.23/#create-a-container>`__ section of the `Docker Remote API <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.23/>`__ and the ``--read-only`` option to ``docker run`` .
        
          - **privileged** *(boolean) --* 
        
            When this parameter is true, the container is given elevated privileges on the host container instance (similar to the ``root`` user).

        :type parameters: dict
        :param parameters: 
        
          Additional parameters passed to the job that replace parameter substitution placeholders that are set in the job definition. Parameters are specified as a key and value pair mapping. Parameters in a ``SubmitJob`` request override any corresponding parameter defaults from the job definition.

        :param containerOverrides: 
        
          A list of container overrides in JSON format that specify the name of a container in the specified job definition and the overrides it should receive. You can override the default command for a container (that is specified in the job definition or the Docker image) with a ``command`` override. You can also override existing environment variables (that are specified in the job definition or Docker image) on a container or add new environment variables to it with an ``environment`` override.
        
          - **vcpus** *(integer) --* 
        
            The number of vCPUs to reserve for the container. This value overrides the value set in the job definition.
        
          - **memory** *(integer) --* 
        
            The number of MiB of memory reserved for the job. This value overrides the value set in the job definition.

            The command to send to the container that overrides the default command from the Docker image or the job definition.
        
            - *(string) --* 
        
          - **environment** *(list) --* 
        
            The environment variables to send to the container. You can add new environment variables, which are added to the container at launch, or you can override the existing environment variables from the Docker image or the job definition.
        
            .. note::
        
              Environment variables must not start with ``AWS_BATCH`` ; this naming convention is reserved for variables that are set by the AWS Batch service.
        
            - *(dict) --* 
        
              A key-value pair object.
        
              - **name** *(string) --* 
        
                The name of the key-value pair. For environment variables, this is the name of the environment variable.
        
              - **value** *(string) --* 
        
                The value of the key-value pair. For environment variables, this is the value of the environment variable.
        
        :type retryStrategy: dict
        :param retryStrategy: 
        
          The retry strategy to use for failed jobs from this  SubmitJob operation. When a retry strategy is specified here, it overrides the retry strategy defined in the job definition.
        
          - **attempts** *(integer) --* 
        
            The number of times to move a job to the ``RUNNABLE`` status. You may specify between 1 and 10 attempts. If the value of ``attempts`` is greater than one, the job is retried if it fails until it has moved to ``RUNNABLE`` that many times.
        
        :type timeout: dict
        :param timeout: 
        
          The timeout configuration for this  SubmitJob operation. You can specify a timeout duration after which AWS Batch terminates your jobs if they have not finished. If a job is terminated due to a timeout, it is not retried. The minimum value for the timeout is 60 seconds. This configuration overrides any timeout configuration specified in the job definition. For array jobs, child jobs have the same timeout configuration as the parent job. For more information, see `Job Timeouts <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/job_timeouts.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .
        
          - **attemptDurationSeconds** *(integer) --* 
        
            The time duration in seconds (measured from the job attempt\'s ``startedAt`` timestamp) after which AWS Batch terminates your jobs if they have not finished.

          If your specified role has a path other than ``/`` , then you must either specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name with the path.
        
          .. note::
        
            Depending on how you created your AWS Batch service role, its ARN may contain the ``service-role`` path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, AWS Batch assumes that your ARN does not use the ``service-role`` path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.
