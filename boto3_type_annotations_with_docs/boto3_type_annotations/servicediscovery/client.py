          A complex type that contains information about the records that you want Route 53 to create when you register an instance. 
        
          - **NamespaceId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
            The ID of the namespace to use for DNS configuration.
        
          - **RoutingPolicy** *(string) --* 
        
            The routing policy that you want to apply to all records that Route 53 creates when you register an instance and specify this service.
        
            .. note::
        
              If you want to use this service to register instances that create alias records, specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the routing policy.
        
            You can specify the following values:
        
             **MULTIVALUE**  
        
            If you define a health check for the service and the health check is healthy, Route 53 returns the applicable value for up to eight instances.
        
            For example, suppose the service includes configurations for one A record and a health check, and you use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with IP addresses for up to eight healthy instances. If fewer than eight instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to every DNS query with the IP addresses for all of the healthy instances.
        
            If you don\'t define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the values for up to eight instances.
        
            For more information about the multivalue routing policy, see `Multivalue Answer Routing <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-multivalue>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .
        
             **WEIGHTED**  
        
            Route 53 returns the applicable value from one randomly selected instance from among the instances that you registered using the same service. Currently, all records have the same weight, so you can\'t route more or less traffic to any instances.
        
            For example, suppose the service includes configurations for one A record and a health check, and you use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the IP address for one randomly selected instance from among the healthy instances. If no instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries as if all of the instances were healthy.
        
            If you don\'t define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the applicable value for one randomly selected instance.
        
            For more information about the weighted routing policy, see `Weighted Routing <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-weighted>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .
        
          - **DnsRecords** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
            An array that contains one ``DnsRecord`` object for each record that you want Route 53 to create when you register an instance.
        
            - *(dict) --* 
        
              A complex type that contains information about the records that you want Route 53 to create when you register an instance.
        
              - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
                The type of the resource, which indicates the type of value that Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries.
        
                Note the following:
        
                * **A, AAAA, and SRV records: You can specify settings for a maximum of one A, one AAAA, and one SRV record. You can specify them in any combination.**   
                 
                * **CNAME records:** If you specify ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` , you can\'t define any other records. This is a limitation of DNS—you can\'t create a CNAME record and any other type of record that has the same name as a CNAME record. 
                 
                * **Alias records:** If you want Route 53 to create an alias record when you register an instance, specify ``A`` or ``AAAA`` for ``Type`` . 
                 
                * **All records:** You specify settings other than ``TTL`` and ``Type`` when you register an instance. 
                 
                The following values are supported:
        
                 **A**  
        
                Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4 format, such as 192.0.2.44.
        
                 **AAAA**  
        
                Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv6 format, such as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.
        
                 **CNAME**  
        
                Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such as www.example.com. Note the following:
        
                * You specify the domain name that you want to route traffic to when you register an instance. For more information, see  RegisterInstanceRequest$Attributes . 
                 
                * You must specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the value of ``RoutingPolicy`` . 
                 
                * You can\'t specify both ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` and settings for ``HealthCheckConfig`` . If you do, the request will fail with an ``InvalidInput`` error. 
                 
                 **SRV**  
        
                Route 53 returns the value for an SRV record. The value for an SRV record uses the following values:
        
                 ``priority weight port service-hostname``  
        
                Note the following about the values:
        
                * The values of ``priority`` and ``weight`` are both set to ``1`` and can\'t be changed.  
                 
                * The value of ``port`` comes from the value that you specify for the ``AWS_INSTANCE_PORT`` attribute when you submit a  RegisterInstance request.  
                 
                * The value of ``service-hostname`` is a concatenation of the following values: 
        
                  * The value that you specify for ``InstanceId`` when you register an instance. 
                   
                  * The name of the service. 
                   
                  * The name of the namespace.  
                   
                For example, if the value of ``InstanceId`` is ``test`` , the name of the service is ``backend`` , and the name of the namespace is ``example.com`` , the value of ``service-hostname`` is:
        
                 ``test.backend.example.com``  
        
                If you specify settings for an SRV record and if you specify values for ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`` , ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`` , or both in the ``RegisterInstance`` request, Route 53 automatically creates ``A`` and/or ``AAAA`` records that have the same name as the value of ``service-hostname`` in the SRV record. You can ignore these records.
        
              - **TTL** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
                The amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS resolvers to cache the settings for this record.
        
                .. note::
        
                  Alias records don\'t include a TTL because Route 53 uses the TTL for the AWS resource that an alias record routes traffic to. If you include the ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`` attribute when you submit a  RegisterInstance request, the ``TTL`` value is ignored. Always specify a TTL for the service; you can use a service to register instances that create either alias or non-alias records.
        
        :type HealthCheckConfig: dict
        :param HealthCheckConfig: 
        
           *Public DNS namespaces only.* A complex type that contains settings for an optional health check. If you specify settings for a health check, Route 53 associates the health check with all the records that you specify in ``DnsConfig`` .
        
          For information about the charges for health checks, see `Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing>`__ .
        
          - **Type** *(string) --* 
        
            The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy.
        
            .. warning::
        
              You can\'t change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.
        
            You can create the following types of health checks:
        
            * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400. 
             
            * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400. 
        
            .. warning::
        
               If you specify HTTPS for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or later. 
        
            * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. 
             
            For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .
        
          - **ResourcePath** *(string) --* 
        
            The path that you want Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx when the endpoint is healthy, such as the file ``/docs/route53-health-check.html`` . Route 53 automatically adds the DNS name for the service and a leading forward slash (``/`` ) character. 
        
          - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --* 
        
            The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .

            - **Service** *(dict) --* 
        
              A complex type that contains information about the new service.
        
              - **Id** *(string) --* 
        
                The ID that Route 53 assigned to the service when you created it.
        
              - **Arn** *(string) --* 
        
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that Route 53 assigns to the service when you create it.
        
              - **Name** *(string) --* 
        
                The name of the service.
        
              - **Description** *(string) --* 
        
                The description of the service.
        
              - **InstanceCount** *(integer) --* 
        
                The number of instances that are currently associated with the service. Instances that were previously associated with the service but that have been deleted are not included in the count.
        
              - **DnsConfig** *(dict) --* 
        
                A complex type that contains information about the records that you want Route 53 to create when you register an instance.
        
                - **NamespaceId** *(string) --* 
        
                  The ID of the namespace to use for DNS configuration.
        
                - **RoutingPolicy** *(string) --* 
        
                  The routing policy that you want to apply to all records that Route 53 creates when you register an instance and specify this service.
        
                  .. note::
        
                    If you want to use this service to register instances that create alias records, specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the routing policy.
        
                  You can specify the following values:
        
                   **MULTIVALUE**  
        
                  If you define a health check for the service and the health check is healthy, Route 53 returns the applicable value for up to eight instances.
        
                  For example, suppose the service includes configurations for one A record and a health check, and you use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with IP addresses for up to eight healthy instances. If fewer than eight instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to every DNS query with the IP addresses for all of the healthy instances.
        
                  If you don\'t define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the values for up to eight instances.
        
                  For more information about the multivalue routing policy, see `Multivalue Answer Routing <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-multivalue>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .
        
                   **WEIGHTED**  
        
                  Route 53 returns the applicable value from one randomly selected instance from among the instances that you registered using the same service. Currently, all records have the same weight, so you can\'t route more or less traffic to any instances.
        
                  For example, suppose the service includes configurations for one A record and a health check, and you use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the IP address for one randomly selected instance from among the healthy instances. If no instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries as if all of the instances were healthy.
        
                  If you don\'t define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the applicable value for one randomly selected instance.
        
                  For more information about the weighted routing policy, see `Weighted Routing <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-weighted>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .
        
                - **DnsRecords** *(list) --* 
        
                  An array that contains one ``DnsRecord`` object for each record that you want Route 53 to create when you register an instance.
        
                  - *(dict) --* 
        
                    A complex type that contains information about the records that you want Route 53 to create when you register an instance.
        
                    - **Type** *(string) --* 
        
                      The type of the resource, which indicates the type of value that Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries.
        
                      Note the following:
        
                      * **A, AAAA, and SRV records: You can specify settings for a maximum of one A, one AAAA, and one SRV record. You can specify them in any combination.**   
                       
                      * **CNAME records:** If you specify ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` , you can\'t define any other records. This is a limitation of DNS—you can\'t create a CNAME record and any other type of record that has the same name as a CNAME record. 
                       
                      * **Alias records:** If you want Route 53 to create an alias record when you register an instance, specify ``A`` or ``AAAA`` for ``Type`` . 
                       
                      * **All records:** You specify settings other than ``TTL`` and ``Type`` when you register an instance. 
                       
                      The following values are supported:
        
                       **A**  
        
                      Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4 format, such as 192.0.2.44.
        
                       **AAAA**  
        
                      Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv6 format, such as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.
        
                       **CNAME**  
        
                      Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such as www.example.com. Note the following:
        
                      * You specify the domain name that you want to route traffic to when you register an instance. For more information, see  RegisterInstanceRequest$Attributes . 
                       
                      * You must specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the value of ``RoutingPolicy`` . 
                       
                      * You can\'t specify both ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` and settings for ``HealthCheckConfig`` . If you do, the request will fail with an ``InvalidInput`` error. 
                       
                       **SRV**  
        
                      Route 53 returns the value for an SRV record. The value for an SRV record uses the following values:
        
                       ``priority weight port service-hostname``  
        
                      Note the following about the values:
        
                      * The values of ``priority`` and ``weight`` are both set to ``1`` and can\'t be changed.  
                       
                      * The value of ``port`` comes from the value that you specify for the ``AWS_INSTANCE_PORT`` attribute when you submit a  RegisterInstance request.  
                       
                      * The value of ``service-hostname`` is a concatenation of the following values: 
        
                        * The value that you specify for ``InstanceId`` when you register an instance. 
                         
                        * The name of the service. 
                         
                        * The name of the namespace.  
                         
                      For example, if the value of ``InstanceId`` is ``test`` , the name of the service is ``backend`` , and the name of the namespace is ``example.com`` , the value of ``service-hostname`` is:
        
                       ``test.backend.example.com``  
        
                      If you specify settings for an SRV record and if you specify values for ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`` , ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`` , or both in the ``RegisterInstance`` request, Route 53 automatically creates ``A`` and/or ``AAAA`` records that have the same name as the value of ``service-hostname`` in the SRV record. You can ignore these records.
        
                    - **TTL** *(integer) --* 
        
                      The amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS resolvers to cache the settings for this record.
        
                      .. note::
        
                        Alias records don\'t include a TTL because Route 53 uses the TTL for the AWS resource that an alias record routes traffic to. If you include the ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`` attribute when you submit a  RegisterInstance request, the ``TTL`` value is ignored. Always specify a TTL for the service; you can use a service to register instances that create either alias or non-alias records.
        
              - **HealthCheckConfig** *(dict) --* 
        
                 *Public DNS namespaces only.* A complex type that contains settings for an optional health check. If you specify settings for a health check, Route 53 associates the health check with all the records that you specify in ``DnsConfig`` .
        
                For information about the charges for health checks, see `Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing>`__ .
        
                - **Type** *(string) --* 
        
                  The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy.
        
                  .. warning::
        
                    You can\'t change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.
        
                  You can create the following types of health checks:
        
                  * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400. 
                   
                  * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400. 
        
                  .. warning::
        
                     If you specify HTTPS for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or later. 
        
                  * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. 
                   
                  For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .
        
                - **ResourcePath** *(string) --* 
        
                  The path that you want Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx when the endpoint is healthy, such as the file ``/docs/route53-health-check.html`` . Route 53 automatically adds the DNS name for the service and a leading forward slash (``/`` ) character. 
        
                - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --* 
        
                  The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .
        
              - **HealthCheckCustomConfig** *(dict) --* 
                
                - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --* 
            
              - **CreateDate** *(datetime) --* 
        
                The date and time that the service was created, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of ``CreateDate`` is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value ``1516925490.087`` represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.
        
              - **CreatorRequestId** *(string) --* 
        
                A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of executing the operation twice. ``CreatorRequestId`` can be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp.

          - *(dict) --* 
            
            - **Instance** *(dict) --* 
        
              A complex type that contains information about a specified instance.
        
              - **Id** *(string) --* 
        
                An identifier that you want to associate with the instance. Note the following:
        
                * If the service that is specified by ``ServiceId`` includes settings for an SRV record, the value of ``InstanceId`` is automatically included as part of the value for the SRV record. For more information, see  DnsRecord$Type . 
                 
                * You can use this value to update an existing instance. 
                 
                * To register a new instance, you must specify a value that is unique among instances that you register by using the same service.  
                 
                * If you specify an existing ``InstanceId`` and ``ServiceId`` , Route 53 updates the existing records. If there\'s also an existing health check, Route 53 deletes the old health check and creates a new one.  
        
                .. note::
        
                   The health check isn\'t deleted immediately, so it will still appear for a while if you submit a ``ListHealthChecks`` request, for example. 
        
              - **CreatorRequestId** *(string) --* 
        
                A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed ``RegisterInstance`` requests to be retried without the risk of executing the operation twice. You must use a unique ``CreatorRequestId`` string every time you submit a ``RegisterInstance`` request if you\'re registering additional instances for the same namespace and service. ``CreatorRequestId`` can be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp.
        
              - **Attributes** *(dict) --* 
        
                A string map that contains the following information for the service that you specify in ``ServiceId`` :
        
                * The attributes that apply to the records that are defined in the service.  
                 
                * For each attribute, the applicable value. 
                 
                Supported attribute keys include the following:
        
                 **AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME**  
        
                If you want Route 53 to create an alias record that routes traffic to an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. For information about how to get the DNS name, see \"DNSName\" in the topic `AliasTarget <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/http:/docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_AliasTarget.html>`__ .
        
                Note the following:
        
                * The configuration for the service that is specified by ``ServiceId`` must include settings for an A record, an AAAA record, or both. 
                 
                * In the service that is specified by ``ServiceId`` , the value of ``RoutingPolicy`` must be ``WEIGHTED`` . 
                 
                * If the service that is specified by ``ServiceId`` includes ``HealthCheckConfig`` settings, Route 53 will create the health check, but it won\'t associate the health check with the alias record. 
                 
                * Auto naming currently doesn\'t support creating alias records that route traffic to AWS resources other than ELB load balancers. 
                 
                * If you specify a value for ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`` , don\'t specify values for any of the ``AWS_INSTANCE`` attributes. 
                 
                 **AWS_INSTANCE_CNAME**  
        
                If the service configuration includes a CNAME record, the domain name that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, ``example.com`` .
        
                This value is required if the service specified by ``ServiceId`` includes settings for an CNAME record.
        
                 **AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4**  
        
                If the service configuration includes an A record, the IPv4 address that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, ``192.0.2.44`` .
        
                This value is required if the service specified by ``ServiceId`` includes settings for an A record. If the service includes settings for an SRV record, you must specify a value for ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`` , ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`` , or both.
        
                 **AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6**  
        
                If the service configuration includes an AAAA record, the IPv6 address that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` .
        
                This value is required if the service specified by ``ServiceId`` includes settings for an AAAA record. If the service includes settings for an SRV record, you must specify a value for ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`` , ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`` , or both.
        
                 **AWS_INSTANCE_PORT**  
        
                If the service includes an SRV record, the value that you want Route 53 to return for the port.
        
                If the service includes ``HealthCheckConfig`` , the port on the endpoint that you want Route 53 to send requests to. 
        
                This value is required if you specified settings for an SRV record when you created the service.

          - *(dict) --* 
            
            - **Service** *(dict) --* 
        
              A complex type that contains information about the service.
        
              - **Id** *(string) --* 
        
                The ID that Route 53 assigned to the service when you created it.
        
              - **Arn** *(string) --* 
        
                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that Route 53 assigns to the service when you create it.
        
              - **Name** *(string) --* 
        
                The name of the service.
        
              - **Description** *(string) --* 
        
                The description of the service.
        
              - **InstanceCount** *(integer) --* 
        
                The number of instances that are currently associated with the service. Instances that were previously associated with the service but that have been deleted are not included in the count.
        
              - **DnsConfig** *(dict) --* 
        
                A complex type that contains information about the records that you want Route 53 to create when you register an instance.
        
                - **NamespaceId** *(string) --* 
        
                  The ID of the namespace to use for DNS configuration.
        
                - **RoutingPolicy** *(string) --* 
        
                  The routing policy that you want to apply to all records that Route 53 creates when you register an instance and specify this service.
        
                  .. note::
        
                    If you want to use this service to register instances that create alias records, specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the routing policy.
        
                  You can specify the following values:
        
                   **MULTIVALUE**  
        
                  If you define a health check for the service and the health check is healthy, Route 53 returns the applicable value for up to eight instances.
        
                  For example, suppose the service includes configurations for one A record and a health check, and you use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with IP addresses for up to eight healthy instances. If fewer than eight instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to every DNS query with the IP addresses for all of the healthy instances.
        
                  If you don\'t define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the values for up to eight instances.
        
                  For more information about the multivalue routing policy, see `Multivalue Answer Routing <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-multivalue>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .
        
                   **WEIGHTED**  
        
                  Route 53 returns the applicable value from one randomly selected instance from among the instances that you registered using the same service. Currently, all records have the same weight, so you can\'t route more or less traffic to any instances.
        
                  For example, suppose the service includes configurations for one A record and a health check, and you use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the IP address for one randomly selected instance from among the healthy instances. If no instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries as if all of the instances were healthy.
        
                  If you don\'t define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the applicable value for one randomly selected instance.
        
                  For more information about the weighted routing policy, see `Weighted Routing <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-weighted>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .
        
                - **DnsRecords** *(list) --* 
        
                  An array that contains one ``DnsRecord`` object for each record that you want Route 53 to create when you register an instance.
        
                  - *(dict) --* 
        
                    A complex type that contains information about the records that you want Route 53 to create when you register an instance.
        
                    - **Type** *(string) --* 
        
                      The type of the resource, which indicates the type of value that Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries.
        
                      Note the following:
        
                      * **A, AAAA, and SRV records: You can specify settings for a maximum of one A, one AAAA, and one SRV record. You can specify them in any combination.**   
                       
                      * **CNAME records:** If you specify ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` , you can\'t define any other records. This is a limitation of DNS—you can\'t create a CNAME record and any other type of record that has the same name as a CNAME record. 
                       
                      * **Alias records:** If you want Route 53 to create an alias record when you register an instance, specify ``A`` or ``AAAA`` for ``Type`` . 
                       
                      * **All records:** You specify settings other than ``TTL`` and ``Type`` when you register an instance. 
                       
                      The following values are supported:
        
                       **A**  
        
                      Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4 format, such as 192.0.2.44.
        
                       **AAAA**  
        
                      Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv6 format, such as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.
        
                       **CNAME**  
        
                      Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such as www.example.com. Note the following:
        
                      * You specify the domain name that you want to route traffic to when you register an instance. For more information, see  RegisterInstanceRequest$Attributes . 
                       
                      * You must specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the value of ``RoutingPolicy`` . 
                       
                      * You can\'t specify both ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` and settings for ``HealthCheckConfig`` . If you do, the request will fail with an ``InvalidInput`` error. 
                       
                       **SRV**  
        
                      Route 53 returns the value for an SRV record. The value for an SRV record uses the following values:
        
                       ``priority weight port service-hostname``  
        
                      Note the following about the values:
        
                      * The values of ``priority`` and ``weight`` are both set to ``1`` and can\'t be changed.  
                       
                      * The value of ``port`` comes from the value that you specify for the ``AWS_INSTANCE_PORT`` attribute when you submit a  RegisterInstance request.  
                       
                      * The value of ``service-hostname`` is a concatenation of the following values: 
        
                        * The value that you specify for ``InstanceId`` when you register an instance. 
                         
                        * The name of the service. 
                         
                        * The name of the namespace.  
                         
                      For example, if the value of ``InstanceId`` is ``test`` , the name of the service is ``backend`` , and the name of the namespace is ``example.com`` , the value of ``service-hostname`` is:
        
                       ``test.backend.example.com``  
        
                      If you specify settings for an SRV record and if you specify values for ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`` , ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`` , or both in the ``RegisterInstance`` request, Route 53 automatically creates ``A`` and/or ``AAAA`` records that have the same name as the value of ``service-hostname`` in the SRV record. You can ignore these records.
        
                    - **TTL** *(integer) --* 
        
                      The amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS resolvers to cache the settings for this record.
        
                      .. note::
        
                        Alias records don\'t include a TTL because Route 53 uses the TTL for the AWS resource that an alias record routes traffic to. If you include the ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`` attribute when you submit a  RegisterInstance request, the ``TTL`` value is ignored. Always specify a TTL for the service; you can use a service to register instances that create either alias or non-alias records.
        
              - **HealthCheckConfig** *(dict) --* 
        
                 *Public DNS namespaces only.* A complex type that contains settings for an optional health check. If you specify settings for a health check, Route 53 associates the health check with all the records that you specify in ``DnsConfig`` .
        
                For information about the charges for health checks, see `Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing>`__ .
        
                - **Type** *(string) --* 
        
                  The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy.
        
                  .. warning::
        
                    You can\'t change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.
        
                  You can create the following types of health checks:
        
                  * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400. 
                   
                  * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400. 
        
                  .. warning::
        
                     If you specify HTTPS for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or later. 
        
                  * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. 
                   
                  For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .
        
                - **ResourcePath** *(string) --* 
        
                  The path that you want Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx when the endpoint is healthy, such as the file ``/docs/route53-health-check.html`` . Route 53 automatically adds the DNS name for the service and a leading forward slash (``/`` ) character. 
        
                - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --* 
        
                  The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .
        
              - **HealthCheckCustomConfig** *(dict) --* 
                
                - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --* 
            
              - **CreateDate** *(datetime) --* 
        
                The date and time that the service was created, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of ``CreateDate`` is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value ``1516925490.087`` represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.
        
              - **CreatorRequestId** *(string) --* 
        
                A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of executing the operation twice. ``CreatorRequestId`` can be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp.

          * If the service that is specified by ``ServiceId`` includes settings for an SRV record, the value of ``InstanceId`` is automatically included as part of the value for the SRV record. For more information, see  DnsRecord$Type . 
           
          * You can use this value to update an existing instance. 
           
          * To register a new instance, you must specify a value that is unique among instances that you register by using the same service.  
           
          * If you specify an existing ``InstanceId`` and ``ServiceId`` , Route 53 updates the existing records. If there\'s also an existing health check, Route 53 deletes the old health check and creates a new one.

          * For each attribute, the applicable value. 
           
          Supported attribute keys include the following:
        
           **AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME**  
        
          If you want Route 53 to create an alias record that routes traffic to an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. For information about how to get the DNS name, see \"DNSName\" in the topic `AliasTarget <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/http:/docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_AliasTarget.html>`__ .
        
          Note the following:
        
          * The configuration for the service that is specified by ``ServiceId`` must include settings for an A record, an AAAA record, or both. 
           
          * In the service that is specified by ``ServiceId`` , the value of ``RoutingPolicy`` must be ``WEIGHTED`` . 
           
          * If the service that is specified by ``ServiceId`` includes ``HealthCheckConfig`` settings, Route 53 will create the health check, but it won\'t associate the health check with the alias record. 
           
          * Auto naming currently doesn\'t support creating alias records that route traffic to AWS resources other than ELB load balancers. 
           
          * If you specify a value for ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`` , don\'t specify values for any of the ``AWS_INSTANCE`` attributes. 
           
           **AWS_INSTANCE_CNAME**

          This value is required if the service specified by ``ServiceId`` includes settings for an CNAME record.
        
           **AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4**  
        
          If the service configuration includes an A record, the IPv4 address that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, ``192.0.2.44`` .
        
          This value is required if the service specified by ``ServiceId`` includes settings for an A record. If the service includes settings for an SRV record, you must specify a value for ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`` , ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`` , or both.
        
           **AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6**  
        
          If the service configuration includes an AAAA record, the IPv6 address that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` .
        
          This value is required if the service specified by ``ServiceId`` includes settings for an AAAA record. If the service includes settings for an SRV record, you must specify a value for ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`` , ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`` , or both.
        
           **AWS_INSTANCE_PORT**  
        
          If the service includes an SRV record, the value that you want Route 53 to return for the port.
        
          If the service includes ``HealthCheckConfig`` , the port on the endpoint that you want Route 53 to send requests to. 
        
          This value is required if you specified settings for an SRV record when you created the service.

                  Note the following:
        
                  * **A, AAAA, and SRV records: You can specify settings for a maximum of one A, one AAAA, and one SRV record. You can specify them in any combination.**   
                   
                  * **CNAME records:** If you specify ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` , you can\'t define any other records. This is a limitation of DNS—you can\'t create a CNAME record and any other type of record that has the same name as a CNAME record. 
                   
                  * **Alias records:** If you want Route 53 to create an alias record when you register an instance, specify ``A`` or ``AAAA`` for ``Type`` . 
                   
                  * **All records:** You specify settings other than ``TTL`` and ``Type`` when you register an instance.

                  Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4 format, such as 192.0.2.44.
        
                   **AAAA**  
        
                  Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv6 format, such as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.
        
                   **CNAME**  
        
                  Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such as www.example.com. Note the following:
        
                  * You specify the domain name that you want to route traffic to when you register an instance. For more information, see  RegisterInstanceRequest$Attributes . 
                   
                  * You must specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the value of ``RoutingPolicy`` . 
                   
                  * You can\'t specify both ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` and settings for ``HealthCheckConfig`` . If you do, the request will fail with an ``InvalidInput`` error. 
                   
                   **SRV**  
        
                  Route 53 returns the value for an SRV record. The value for an SRV record uses the following values:
        
                   ``priority weight port service-hostname``  
        
                  Note the following about the values:
        
                  * The values of ``priority`` and ``weight`` are both set to ``1`` and can\'t be changed.  
                   
                  * The value of ``port`` comes from the value that you specify for the ``AWS_INSTANCE_PORT`` attribute when you submit a  RegisterInstance request.  
                   
                  * The value of ``service-hostname`` is a concatenation of the following values: 
        
                    * The value that you specify for ``InstanceId`` when you register an instance. 
                     
                    * The name of the service. 
                     
                    * The name of the namespace.  
                     
                  For example, if the value of ``InstanceId`` is ``test`` , the name of the service is ``backend`` , and the name of the namespace is ``example.com`` , the value of ``service-hostname`` is:
        
                   ``test.backend.example.com``  
        
                  If you specify settings for an SRV record and if you specify values for ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`` , ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`` , or both in the ``RegisterInstance`` request, Route 53 automatically creates ``A`` and/or ``AAAA`` records that have the same name as the value of ``service-hostname`` in the SRV record. You can ignore these records.
        
                - **TTL** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 
        
                  The amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS resolvers to cache the settings for this record.
        
                  .. note::
        
                    Alias records don\'t include a TTL because Route 53 uses the TTL for the AWS resource that an alias record routes traffic to. If you include the ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`` attribute when you submit a  RegisterInstance request, the ``TTL`` value is ignored. Always specify a TTL for the service; you can use a service to register instances that create either alias or non-alias records.
        
          - **HealthCheckConfig** *(dict) --* 
        
             *Public DNS namespaces only.* A complex type that contains settings for an optional health check. If you specify settings for a health check, Amazon Route 53 associates the health check with all the records that you specify in ``DnsConfig`` .
        
             **A and AAAA records**  
        
            If ``DnsConfig`` includes configurations for both A and AAAA records, Route 53 creates a health check that uses the IPv4 address to check the health of the resource. If the endpoint that is specified by the IPv4 address is unhealthy, Route 53 considers both the A and AAAA records to be unhealthy. 
        
             **CNAME records**  
        
            You can\'t specify settings for ``HealthCheckConfig`` when the ``DNSConfig`` includes ``CNAME`` for the value of ``Type`` . If you do, the ``CreateService`` request will fail with an ``InvalidInput`` error.
        
             **Request interval**  
        
            The health check uses 30 seconds as the request interval. This is the number of seconds between the time that each Route 53 health checker gets a response from your endpoint and the time that it sends the next health check request. A health checker in each data center around the world sends your endpoint a health check request every 30 seconds. On average, your endpoint receives a health check request about every two seconds. Health checkers in different data centers don\'t coordinate with one another, so you\'ll sometimes see several requests per second followed by a few seconds with no health checks at all.
        
             **Health checking regions**  
        
            Health checkers perform checks from all Route 53 health-checking regions. For a list of the current regions, see `Regions <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_HealthCheckConfig.html#Route53-Type-HealthCheckConfig-Regions>`__ .
        
             **Alias records**  
        
            When you register an instance, if you include the ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`` attribute, Route 53 creates an alias record. Note the following:
        
            * Route 53 automatically sets ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to true for alias records. When ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` is true, the alias record inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource. such as an ELB load balancer. For more information, see `EvaluateTargetHealth <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_AliasTarget.html#Route53-Type-AliasTarget-EvaluateTargetHealth>`__ . 
             
            * If you include ``HealthCheckConfig`` and then use the service to register an instance that creates an alias record, Route 53 doesn\'t create the health check. 
             
            For information about the charges for health checks, see `Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing>`__ .
        
            - **Type** *(string) --* 
        
              The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy.
        
              .. warning::
        
                You can\'t change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.
        
              You can create the following types of health checks:
        
              * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400. 
               
              * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400. 
        
              .. warning::
        
                 If you specify HTTPS for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or later. 
        
              * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. 
               
              For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .
        
            - **ResourcePath** *(string) --* 
        
              The path that you want Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx when the endpoint is healthy, such as the file ``/docs/route53-health-check.html`` . Route 53 automatically adds the DNS name for the service and a leading forward slash (``/`` ) character. 
        
            - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --* 
        
              The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .
