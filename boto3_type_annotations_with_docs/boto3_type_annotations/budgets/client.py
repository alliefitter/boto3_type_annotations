            If you create your budget and don\'t specify a start date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose ``DAILY`` , and didn\'t set a start date, AWS set your start date to ``01/24/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you chose ``MONTHLY`` , AWS set your start date to ``01/01/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you didn\'t specify an end date, AWS set your end date to ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API. 
        
            You can change either date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.
        
            After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications and subscribers.

                The type of threshold for a notification. For ``ABSOLUTE_VALUE`` thresholds, AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over your total cost threshold. For ``PERCENTAGE`` thresholds, AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over a certain percentage of your forecasted spend. For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you have a ``PERCENTAGE`` threshold of 80%, AWS notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.
        
              - **NotificationState** *(string) --* 
        
                Whether this notification is in alarm. If a budget notification is in the ``ALARM`` state, you have passed the set threshold for the budget.

            * A ``subscriptionType`` of ``EMAIL``   
             
            * An ``address`` of ``example@example.com``

                If you create your budget and don\'t specify a start date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose ``DAILY`` , and didn\'t set a start date, AWS set your start date to ``01/24/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you chose ``MONTHLY`` , AWS set your start date to ``01/01/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you didn\'t specify an end date, AWS set your end date to ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` .

If you chose ``MONTHLY`` , AWS set your start date to ``01/01/18 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

                This is the ARN pattern for a budget: 
        
                 ``arn:aws:budgetservice::AccountId:budget/budgetName``

For ``PERCENTAGE`` thresholds, AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over a certain percentage of your forecasted spend. For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you have a ``PERCENTAGE`` threshold of 80%, AWS notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.
